"Had a good experience when my wife and I sat at the bar. Great pizza and wings. 

However, we tried to go recently with a larger group (8 people) and it was 1.25 hr wait. At 5pm on a Wednesday... Riiiiight.  

I tried to call ahead and they don't accept call aheads. They apparently only have 1 table capable of seating larger parties. Kinda missed the mark on that one Oreganos. Brand spankin new building and all. 

So we went across the street to Native NewYorker and got seated immediately."
"On my first to Montreal with my gf we came here to eat a nice mid day lunch before walking around more and departing from Montreal. Now obviously i am one that has a love/hate relationship with spots that are touristy and well known but in this case it was worth it. I liked the fact that we walked down a nice cobblestone corridor then was greeted by the hostess who promptly showed us to our table. Our seating was right in front where they had two jazz players performing throughout the lunch playing soft melodies for all of the diners entertainment and i always believe with soothing music a meal is always made more enjoyable. 

Looking around this was definite a place i could fall in love with, beautiful flower bed arrangements with different colors that made the restaurant really pop, the large umbrella's which provided a nice cool atmosphere and most importantly shade, plus birds flying around during the meal and  nicely arranged plants i loved the ambiance. The food on the other hand could be improved, with such a nicely designed restaurant i would expect a vast selection, also my gf suggested that when your in a new place you should try new food and i 100% agree with that, but in this case i should have just gotten the salmon, because everything else i looked at on the menu, i just was not feeling. Had the veal meatballs style dish and it wasn't that great i'd say it was at best a 6 out of 10 if i had to grade it. But overall the decor/ambiance made up for that. Plus our waitress was extremely helpful/friendly. I also agree with some of the reviews a bit overpriced for what they were serving."
One of our favorite places to go when it's cold and rainy out.  Re-defines comfort food. And you have to try the Rice Crispy Squares. The best!
"The doctor was very nice, got in in a good amount of time and feel like the visit was acceptable. After seeing the doctor I selected my glasses, I was told about this great way they are ordered right from Oakley and how everything was done right at Oakley. I asked them if they could do a rush even said I would pay more. See explained it usually takes 5-7 business days. I was in on July 3 2014 and today July 23 2014 just got them. The lenses ARE NOT Oakley quality the tint is not even to the edge of the lens. I contacted Oakley to find out the aren't even Oakley lenses. Why did I order these and not even get what I ordered. Not happy at all would not recommended buying for brand from this company!!!"
"The Nook is an immediate phoenix staple!  I came here and met up with the fam, I didn't really have any expectations whatsoever.  I feel like that is the best type of experience to have, it really gives any establishment the opportunity to wow their customers.  That's exactly what The Nook did for me.  I love how it is connected to a hotel with easy access from inside, also the decor was very modern and hipster-ish.  This ""new age"" restaurant atmosphere that numbers of restaurant owners have adopted is so amazing.  The Nook sets the ambiance to a very relaxed, comfortable feeling which makes it great to come in groups. 

The mixologist Dustin is very skillful, and constructed the drink menu himself from my understanding.  He definitely sets the bar for any other bartender out there.  By experimenting with different aromas all the way to different types of seasonings.  He truly makes it a day to remember.  Check out my pics of the drinks he made, I attached the recipes.

I love how the city is coming to fruition, with so many new and upcoming restaurants like The Nook, it makes me proud to be a Phoenician."
The server stepped on my foot while we were waiting to be seated. She acted as if she didn't feel anything. No apology at all!
"Place seems like a scam. 
I was gifted a groupon for a free exam/X-rays/cleaning. 
You walk in and have to fill out all sorts of paper work (lots of repeat)
  They give you X-rays and the doctor sees you. The cute technician schedules you an appointment for a month from now and sends you off. Didn't see one person actually getting work done."
"Very good buffet!!!  Cold snow crab legs (2 kinds) cracked open for you, prime rib, BBQ ribs, roasted chicken, sushi, ceviche, pasta (lobster ravioli, manicotti, and penne), fruits, dessert.  

I only wish the snow crab legs could be served hot with butter, but everything was good and fresh, their seafood was the best thing they had!!  Prime rib was good but all the other meats were just OK.  Their carrot cake and passion fruit mousse was really good for dessert.  Pasta was also very good."
"This bar is a fantastic place to get very well made cocktails and beer and wine. The bartenders are all keg. Been here multiple times and I love their ""old fashion"". Also try their mint julep, very refreshing. One negative, is that sometimes they have the music way too loud. 

Tip: if you're here to get a beer or a glass of wine, I suggest you may be plan on doing that somewhere else and try these bartenders' well mixed drinks. Enjoy!"
"The food and the service each were ""O K""  but I probably would not recommend this place.  Walked in w/family on a Saturday for lunch and three drunk people at the bar looked at us as if we were from mars. 

The waitress was ok, but we had to ask for refills, the check, etc.  She didn't want to be there, however she did a sufficient enough job.  The food was bland, but at least it was prepared properly.  Id go back for a game, but that's probably it."
"The ramen we ordered was the Morris ramen. It costs 13 dollars. The broth was a bit salty for my
Taste but overall was delicious. Not super crowded and has lots of seating. Definitely will eat here again and would say is the best ramen place in Madison. Main complaint is that it is a bit pricey."
"Decided on this place because of the Yelp reviews.  It wasnt disappointing at all.  It looks crazy from the outside and I had no idea the kind of place I was walking into.  But once insides, feels like a little diner or normal breakfast spot.  I ordered a steak and onion and pepper skillet.  It came with my choice of hashed browns or potatoes and i went with the hash browns.  Visually, with the fresh guacamole slices on top, it was amazing.  It looked like the best, most well put together dish I have ever seen for breakfast.  It was a little bland though.  It needs some hot sauce, and just felt like it was missing some seasoning.  But it was super fresh, and when the hot sauce was added it was outstanding.  I would come back for sure, and would like to see how some of the other items taste and look."
"One of the most annoying things about Costco is that you find something you love and its either seasonal or they just get rid of it. They have carried the box of  edamame in a large box that contains 12 individual packs for a long time and now all of a sudden they got rid of it and are carrying a large bag that is half the price and nowhere near the quality.  The beans or low grade and most or yellow or brown and taste stringy and terrible. My daughter will no longer take it to school for lunch.  I will try Sam's Club and if they have them I will be moving my membership.  People have devoted whole blogs online to these packs of edamame and now they get rid of them.  Same thing with some Angus burgers they used to carry.  It's so frustrating, to get use to a staple item and then they remove it.  The least they could do is have one store in a locale stock it. so at least the die-hards can still purchase it."
"I've essentially tried shomal, gilaneh, bank, pomegranate and darband and I would say shatter Abbas is by far the most consistent with amazing fresh kabobs. I hope they keep it up and it doesn't go downhill like all other Persian restos after being in operation for a while. My go to dish is the koobideh!! Amazinggggg"
Terrible was how I would describe the food. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli. Cheese with lobster is fine if it's a delicate cheese it tasted like sharp cheddar sauce. Put some more filling in your ravioli and try a light cream sauce. My sister in law had the risotto another dish done very poorly. My steak was good but a little heavy handed on the salt. Here's a little hint on how to prepare fresh green beans boil for eight minutes then and only then stop the cooking by shocking them.
"A hidden gem ! 
Great cakes .. Love this place. Good selection and great hours. Cookie trays are perfect."
I found Lindsay's work through instagram and am super happy I did! I came in wanting to do an ombre and absolutely love the results. She gave a super knowledgeable consult and 2.5 hours later I left feeling totally refreshed. I was shocked at how affordable the service was considering Calgary tends to be really pricey. Highly recommend :)
"Koo Koo Chicken is a small restaurant in a strip mall at Creditview and Eglinton. They specialize in Taiwanese style fried chicken. Taking pride in the freshness of their dishes, they give you notice that the wait time for your food can be as long as 20 minutes in order to prepare the chicken in the freshest way possible. 

They have a variety of combos centred around their signature fried chicken, and they also tackle many other aspects of Taiwanese cuisine. For my first visit, I ordered combo #1, which includes fried chicken steak (literally a basketful), a basket of fries, and a medium drink. No, not the boring old can of pop or bottle of water, but traditional Taiwanese style drinks. I went with the original milk tea with tapioca. For $9.95, a basketful of chicken and fries and a milk tea? Great value. 

On to the quality of the food - the drinks came first, after about 5 minutes. The milk tea here is absolutely superb. I haven't had anything like it since I went to Asia earlier this year. Next came the fries - they were thinly cut, similar to McDonalds' but more firm and less salty. Also great. After another 5 minutes, the chicken came. The quantity was overwhelming, but in a good way. The quality, as we soon found out, was just as remarkable. It was a unique blend of spices and seasonings that keeps you interested throughout the meal. 

One thing I liked about the tables was that each one had a set of 6 types of seasonings, along with the typical sauces (ketchup, etc.). Seaweed flakes, curry chicken seasoning, lemon chicken seasoning, black pepper, plum seasoning, and a shaker simply marked ""spicy"" - Koo Koo has something for everybody. Of course, I had to try every single one. I'd have to go with the seaweed as my favourite, while plum definitely gets the award for most interesting. 

I gotta admit, while I loved the experience, the while look of the restaurant was a little off-putting. It was very clean, but the decor just didn't make sense to me. Between the patterned carpet, yellow walls, and the corny, totally irrelevant stickers on the walls, the design of the restaurant left a little more to be desired. One of the walls read, I kid you not, ""I miss you because I never miss you."" You can't make this up!

Overall, I'm so glad to have Koo Koo Chicken in Mississauga. There are few Taiwanese restaurant options in the city, which is vastly disproportionate to the quality of their food. I look forward to trying the other Taiwanese dishes at Koo Koo in my future visits."
Eating at this deli is like eating at a NY deli.  They Il Parista sandwich is amazing.  The cheese is fresh and prosciutto is delicious.  The meatballs and spaghetti are equal in taste to NY Italian food.  Excellent food and a quant market with interesting items to try.
"Good food, fast service. It makes me a little sad that '80's music is considered retro but that's life. 
Clean, great decor & branding. Fun place to eat."
"Great brunch, great service. Our server Grant was especially friendly and accommodating. This will be one of our go to spots when out of towners come to visit. The breakfast food was fresh, not greasy, and delicious!"
This property used to be nice when it was owned by the other company now it's all greed I've lived here for 11 months and for the last 5 months I'm surrounded by remodeling of every apartment around me gunshots from the building behind me robberies because of no security and now that they remodeled all the unit the rents have skyrocketed . Just can't take it here anymore don't worry people there's still plenty of beautiful places to live that are reasonable and quiet..yes it is still a dumpy area sure glad I got the hell out of there this Whole Town's turning into the ghetto
"The worst system ever!!!
The black box socks.
Only works for abut one or two years and then gets very slow and then stop working.
Fast forward never work correctly even on the day one."
"It's quite pricy for Chinese food that doesn't involve seafood, but the buns are nicely made- all of them fluffy and pretty tasty. Would go back if it was cheaper.

One point off for server: 
We wanted a hand pulled noodle, the male server informed us it's not available, then we switched to another noodle, he then said the whole section of the menu wasn't available. My husband said fine, green onion pancake, he said I don't know if this is available, let me check and never came back. When my husband later on inquired, he said that wasn't available either but he ordered for us a similar item- smoked meat with pancakes. What the... not to mention he ordered us an item that was 3 times more expensive than what we wanted."
"Very good! This place is very inviting and the staff is great! I highly recommend. We got both pork and eggplant bun. The fried rice and tuna app was excellent, and miso Rahman was too.

The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is I thought it was slightly overpriced. 2 bun was $10. I thought 3 for $10 would have made more sense. The Rahman was $10-$14. We split a few item and it was $50 plus tip."
"Had no plans of stopping here but it caught our eye and thought we would try something on the menu. We ended up eating there and were very impressed with every aspect. Food was fresh and delicious, waitress was helpful and pleasant, and the overall vibe was very down to earth and cozy. Just had that ""home"" feeling to it that is very rare in most places."
"We were wondering for a very long time what was Mimi's Cafe going to be changed to since it closed down. Here it is Los Cucos Mexican food. I think that the place is a great place for families to eat some decent Mexican food. 

Best things about this place we enjoyed were 
Chorizo queso dip 

Fresh tortillas they were definitely home made so buttery and I would come back just to have this

Fajitas were good too. The only thing we didn't enjoy about this was the menu said it was filet mignon and it definitely wasn't filet mignon you can't fool me on that it was thick flank. 

The portions are also huge so you can definitely share 1 plate for two or just don't order an extra appetizer like we did and enjoy the fresh chips n salsa that's free when you eat here. Service was awesome from start to finish. Overall I would come back more if the refried beans were a smoother texture but other than that it's a solid place the only reason I'm giving a 3 star versus a 4 was for the steak issue we had. But it's a solid 4"
"Not pleased with customer service. We patiently waited in line for the car. We finally finished the transaction then waited 30 minutes for the car to arrive; several customers after us received tee it car first. When I asked about it, he says he will check on it. Another 20 minutes passed, I asked again on the car also asking why other customers got their first while we clearly were first. He just said that their cars were already here and that our car was not ready. Mind you it's the same guys (one person) shuttling the cars and getting ready all the cars for all the customers. What a load of crap! 

The car we received had a bunch of dents and was dirty inside when we received it. 

Another terrible customer service point. We are returning the vehicle and we are wrapping up the transaction. A shuttle is preparing to leave. He said he would email is the receipt if we wanted to take the shuttle. No we don't (no trust of this place). So two minutes later we're done with the transaction. Had he just requested the shuttle to just wait literally 2 mins we could be headed to the Airport. 

Shuttle goes every 20 minutes to the airport. What a piece of crappy service. Make sure you allot sufficient time. Actually, don't even bother with renting from this company."
"We came here because it was my Son's choice for his birthday. If it wouldn't have been for his birthday, we would have left, even though it's a hour + drive from our home. As others have mentioned, the service is very slow. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated even though there was no one in front of us. Once seated, we had to wait a while before our waitress came. By the time she came, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we went ahead and gave it to her. The group sitting next to us got their food before us. About 10-15 minutes after that we asked the manager. After he checked on the order, he informed us that our waitress had not put in our order. He then offered us 50% off our meal, and put our order in. We got our food fairly quick after that. I was hoping to be offered something small prior to our food, but no such luck. Everyone was pleased with the food. My club was just an average club though. When we got our check, they charged us for an adult size soda with the kids meal. It was supposed to include a drink. It was also my son's birthday, so we informed them. They came over and sang and gave him a cupcake. They then charged us for the cupcake also. Oh well, at least we got it for 50% off!"
"The service here has been outstanding each of the three or four times I have come to Taxco. The food is fine, solid, not very imaginative, but I've found a couple of things on the menu I enjoy pretty well. They make tasty Horchata (rice milk drink with cinnamon)! I don't think that's on the menu, but you can order it! I also like that the restaurant is nicely decorated and pleasant to be in. Good place to go when you're in the area."
"This place does Hakka food--that is a fusion of Chinese & Indian, for those not aware.  In reality, they also do pure Chinese, Thai and other various random dishes.

Definitely not a superb dining place... decor is pretty blah, service is barely acceptable, but the hey.. there is always the ultimate upside--food is cheap!  Dirt cheap.  

Lunch only:  $5.95 -$6.95, for ""something-on-rice""... 

What is that something?  Chicken & mixed vegetables, mango chicken, general whoever chicken, etc.. All in all, they had a choice of about 30 lunch dishes.

I recommend crispy ginger chicken.  It was breaded chicken pieces, deep fried, in a spice/sweet/sour sauce.  It had a lot of orange zest, which was a nice touch.  The bombay chicken was quite good too (sampled my friends'), which was quite spicy/garlicky/coriandory. 

Oh, and they also throw in a pretty bad spring roll and a can of soda (or in my case, a Nestle bottled water).

For you lazy asses who never pack lunch and eat out all the time, here is a good alternative. Cheaper than your $6.99 Wendy's salad and you still get a drink :)"
"Well, all good things must come to an end, I guess. Went back two more times after my initial review and am sad to say I can no longer give a glowing review. My last visit was on a Wednesday, during the BOGO deal. Ordered two sushi rolls and made sure to tell the server NO spicy mayo. The roll in question came with spicy mayo. When I told the server about it, he apologized and took it back. He said he did tell the chef, but the chef overlooked it. The roll was finally remade and brought back to the table, but both rolls were very mushy. The fish did not appear to be fresh. Really hate that the visit was so disappointing. The previous visit wasn't as good as my initial one, either, but more because of screaming children, not an issue with food or service. Not the restaurant's fault that parents don't control their children in public. Doubt we'll be back, though. Consistency is very important to me when choosing a restaurant. If I have to take a chance that it may or may not be good, I don't care to go there."
"This is a great Hong Kong style cafÃƒÂ© that offers a quick meal at a reasonable price.  If you have no idea how a Hong Kong style cafÃƒÂ©  might be like, picture an Asian Denny's.  It's a loud and bustling venue with a lot of in and out traffic.  If you like variety, here is where you will find an extensive menu of over 300 menu items.  They have specials on a daily basis which consists of an entree, soup, rice or spaghetti, garlic toast and a drink. All this for no more than $15, tax and tip included.  The service is fast and the food is worth every penny.  When people ask for a good Chinese restaurant recommendation, I often reply with four questions ""How traditional?"", ""How adventurous?"" , ""Who are you going with?"" and ""How much are you looking to spend?""  This isn't the place to take your first date, but it offers good food that comes out quick and it is easy on the wallet.  It's not hard to find a dish that is captivating for each person in the party.  There is a wide range of selection from Sweet & Sour Pork with Rice to Deep Fried Pig's Intestine, if neither sounds appealing maybe just settle for a Ham & Egg Sandwich.  Give this place a try, you wont regret it!"
"I recently experienced the Yardbird Southern Table & Bar while staying at the Venetian for a conference trip to Las Vegas. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself intrigued me, setup as a half-bar, half-restaurant establishment painted in black but somehow trying to imagine itself as modern southern chic? That is the best way I can describe it, especially considering that there was a projector displaying images of various southern icons on one wall mixed aside barn-style egg baskets hung up by the ceilings. All of this decor would be perfectly fine, if this restaurant actually had food that lived up to its southern-inspired roots. 

After our waitress gave us an incredible overview of their southern fried chicken, I decided to order a southern fried eggs benedict from their brunch menu. Although it was presented nicely, there was something about the chicken that just didn't taste right. It almost seemed like it was slightly undercooked (although it was hard to tell because the mood lighting i the restaurant was very dark). Additionally, the skin was not as crisp as authentic fried chicken that I have had at other restaurants, which of course is the main appeal of fried chicken in the first place. My boyfriend was lured into this restaurant by a burger that promised a pile of brisket, bacon, pork belly, and other meats stacked on top of it. However, when the burger came out there was barely any meat on it and from what I saw there definitely was not any brisket on it (unless the brisket was so thin it couldn't be seen?). 

We were so tired from walking around the strip, that we chose not to waste our energy on complaining about the burger and simply left, full but unsatisfied. I wanted to post this review mainly as a reminder to myself and fellow yelpers that sometimes it really is best to go to certain restaurants according to locale...because apparently this Las Vegas joint was not able to recreate the the food of the American South, despite its best efforts."
"Have been waiting for a while for this place to open up and it did not disappoint. The veggie options here are actually great. Try the farmstead that comes on a collard green wrap.

Also they are getting their alcohol setup with some local brews. Im gonna make my way through their menu and try everything i can."
Worlds greatest experience! Happy Dog is for lovers. Oh and the hot dogs are awesome. I swear you can't go wrong with any combo you do.
"Good place to eat. Nice atmosphere. 24/7 burger is fantastic. But if you have a menu change on your delivery order, make sure to CALL TO CONFIRM. Otherwise you might not get your request."
"Love this Taiwanese dessert place!

The location is great, the decor is even better, and the desserts are excellent!
Ordered the green tea snow ice last time I came here, I believe it was about $7 after tax which is a damn good price seeing that the snow ice is enormous... It can literally be shared between 2 or 3 people. The food/dessert selection is really big and the service was awesome too; really friendly servers. Decor was simply yet modern, if I do remember correctly this is a relatively new restaurant.

The only thing I was iffy about was the tapioca which didn't taste very good. Could be because it was frozen from the snow ice but nonetheless, I will definitely be returning!"
I don't write reviews often. I only do it when I feel like people need to know. This place was the worst. I just needed an oil change and they took part my whole engine. They tried to charge me for everything and then on top of that when the put it back together. The messed up a whole bunch of stuff. Then they wanted to charge me to fix it all. Biggest scam ever!! Don't go there!!
This was my first time eating here... Was wanting breakfast and I found this little gem... I love the outdoor patio... The traffic does get alittle loud.. But I love the view of the mountains. The two eggs anyway was cooked just like how I love it! The hash drown was crisp and fresh! The bacons... OMG to die for! I'll definitely be coming back with the boyfriend!
"You know how you're always looking for an honest mechanic?  Well, you just found him.  We wish he was here in Salt Lake City, where we live, but are so grateful that he was in Vegas when we needed him.  When he could have taken advantage of us, he did a free diagnostic, chuckled at our worry and sent us away with a new understanding of how a 10 yr old black car works in 104 degree heat with the A/C on full blast for a 4 hour drive.   His daughter did the tests and he took us for a spin just to explain his case.  All this for FREE.  He doesn't accept tips either.  So, if you live there, or are just passing through, please tell him hello and trust that he'll take better care of you than you do your own car."
"My mom wanted to come here for her birthday. The wait was unbelievably long. It took an hour and a half so we walked around the mall for a bit.

The food came in large portions, no different from the one in the states. The waitress made several mistakes and was very forgetful but the food was worth it. Everything was made with butter and very fattening so I couldn't even finish. I had the meatloaf dinner, it came with 3 pieces of meatloaf, asparagus and mashed potatoes.

We ordered a cheesecake and tiramisu but we were too stuffed to finish either of them. We ended up taking most of the food home.

Aside from the forgetful waitress, it was a pretty good experience."
"Andy is a card.  Any New Yorker willing to tout the superiority of his gelato to our group via a song is a man worthy of respect.  And yes, the gelato is delicious.  Spumoni = perfect.  Seriously.

I hope LPC gets around to roasting their own gyro meat again.  The lamb they've been buying hasn't been the same quality, and you can taste the difference.  However, if enough of us ask, maybe he'll start roasting in-house again!  It's worth it, trust me.

This is a great lunchtime spot, and yes, the owner (Andy) is polarizing.  But if you've an open mind and a discriminating sandwich palate (as I do), then you really can't go wrong here.  Oh, and now they're serving beer & wine - before it was BYOB with a corkage.

Try the orzo!"
"Stayed here two nights for the Super Bowl and it was horrible.  We booked a double bed on the second floor. Everything about the room was small. The carpet had white stains. the sink had stains, the mini fridge leaked onto the carpet (we didn't even use it). The beds were hard, the sheets were horrible, the flat sheet had holes. The bathroom was a joke.  BEWARE of the stand up shower, 3 out of the 4 people fell inside the shower. The sides were extremely slippery. Needless to say I will not be returning here. 

Only thing good about this place is the location it's close to freeway and shopping malls."
"Really love the beer, always amazing!  Management needs to upstaff and quit being CHEAP about staffing!  

There were empty tables outside, buy no wait staff.  A bunch of us waiting outside bitched and complained. Two couples left after we told them whats going on.

It's hard on staff, and hard on patrons.  Probably won't be back until they make those changes."
"Not big on flame broiled but we were in the area and needed something to hold us until dinner time. The food is pretty consistent, dry patties, soggy lettuce... My favorite part is the little bit of onion that they have in it lol.

For the most part, it was pretty clean. It's a pretty small dining area but if you're in and out, I guess it's ok :)"
"Our favorite bar in the South Hills. Friendly staff who get to know you, free candy at every seat and GREAT food and drink. Cozy atmosphere. Worth our 20 minute drive, every time."
"The waffles started off as good, but fairly plain at this late night eatery right next to the Shadow Lounge.  Over the months of redecoration & retooling their recipes, the waffles have gotten better & better!  The hours have expanded (in time for me to move out of Pittsburgh, of course) making the waffles even more attainable.

The savory waffle (bacon, egg & cheese) is delicious, though the presentation could look better sometimes.  If they have the Bananas Foster waffle, that's a must!  I was there the first night they made it as a trial waffle, and they ran out of bananas because it was so popular!

Oh, and the talk show is quite amusing.  I have no clue where they get the guests, but it provides great entertainment to go along with the waffles."
"It was my first time ordering from this place, as it was close to my home. After searching through door dash and grub hub I decided to check the reviews on yelp of these places. This place had a nice rating score to reviews ratio. I decided to check the menu out and cross-reference any pics in the album. Everything looked pretty good and I kept seeing these noodles. So, I too ordered the chicken linguine noodles. The cashew veggie stir-fry with an extra side of rice. I was feeling really good so I also got a Thai tea. Everything was fresh and was actually really good. The Thai tea was a little extra sweet but that could just be me. The only thing they could improve on is the communication. I never got a confirmation alert. After about 45 mins I called to place to confirm and the lady said my order was out for delivery. Too bad for the drive not having change I wasn't able to tip. I would order again."
"Good selection of food choices, fairly decent service. Server staff could make more effort to check in more with customers, refill waters and bill distribution took a fair amount of time."
Not really sure what people see in this place.  The employees are rude and the sandwiches and ok. Not great but ok.  The price they charge is a little steep for what you get.  There are plenty of places around to get a amazing sandwich or  sub that those place really needs to step up their game
"You make people throw out sealed, full water bottles at security. Then you don't have enough staff so people wait 30 mins in line for a drink to pay $15. Miss part of the show you paid $$$$ to see. Horrible. Makes sense from an arena named after a 3rd tier mobile service."
"Finally checked out the downtown location tonight. Much funkier and quite a bit roomier than the Camelback location. Seemed to have a cute little patio but didn't get to explore much since it was so packed on First Friday. They had a DJ playing hip hop jams and anime going on the TVs so if the crowd doesn't bother you, it's an awesome place to chill with a sweet treat. And speaking of treats, the matcha combo cup was everything I have ever wanted in a frozen dessert: matcha snoh topped with red beans, condensed milk and little mochi balls. Bought a ""medium"" (they're huge) to share with the hubby but he wasn't a fan. I guess beans and ice cream aren't for everyone... I was worried it would go to waste but I killed that whole thing like I was getting revenge on it."
"The place is very clean and organized. The parking can be a little hectic on busy shopping days. The ability to make appointments online or on the EWC app is awesome. (Although you can't cancel or modify your appointment without calling the location.)
The aestheticians that I have worked with( about 6 of them) over the past 6 months have been professional and listen to what I wanted. I am very simple- upper lip and sometimes eyebrows. No real way to mess up the mustache, but my eyebrows are precious since they don't grow as quickly now that I am in my 40s. I get a little worried because the gals that work there have  such a varied eyebrow look-from really thick and dark, to thin and penciled in- I make sure to let them know to only clean up the strays and not to take off a lot of hairs. They have been good at doing what I ask. 
I am in and out within 5 mins. They have engaged in small talk which is nice to distract from the discomfort. 
My gripe is with the front desk. They are so cold, and uninviting, and just rude. When you are checking in or out and another customer comes in or calls-- they will abruptly stop working with you and address the other customer without asking you to ""wait one minute"" or ""can you hold please?"" They just stop talking to you even if you are in mid sentence. They are pushy with  products sales and the wax packages that it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
I will continue to come back for my monthly visits, but I won't expect any warm and fuzzy treatment from the front desk staff."
"The Paiza club in the Palazzo on the 50th floor is as good as it gets. We had a private room for dining and had the option of ordering anything, as long as it was Asian food, on and off the menu. I wanted some eggs and they provided it, done with a 5 star flare. I asked for Vietnamese Pho and they provided that as well, which amazed the hell outta me because I thought Pho stew had to be made 12 hours in advance. We asked for Johnny Walker Blue Label and it was brought to our table. As a matter of fact, we asked for bottles of the stuff and they gladly obliged, leaving it there and asking if they should pour it or if we will. The orange juice was fresh squeezed as it was ordered. Luckily for them, I didn't want apple or watermelon juice. 

I would quote some prices but I can't remember any. I just recall the Blue Label in the price range of $450-550. Some of the entrees were up in the hundreds. 

Pros: Everything. The service. The food. The shark fin soup that I thought was noodles. 

Cons: None. But if we had to pay for it then the con would be the price. 

Other thoughts: I will be rich one day just so I can enjoy this type of lavish living all the time. But then again, I'd probably die early if I lived like this all the time. Too rich for my blood. Pun intended."
Thanks for taking out the price scanners and offering an app that isn't compatible with my phone.  You think I'm going to wait behind 10 people at your slow a$$ registers to get a price scan? Nope. One of the many reasons you are careening toward bankruptcy. Never think of the customers needs.
"This is a good go to place to get delivery or take out. I prefer take out because you never know the journey your order goes on once it leaves the restaurant for delivery. 
 I call ahead and 20-30 minutes later the order is ready. 
I sure LOVE their ranch dressing- and so does everyone else because they charged me almost 3$ for 2 extra cups. 
I wouldn't recommend dining in unless necessary because there isn't much going for the place as far as ambiance. There is a TV to keep you entertained. The kitchen is open which is great, but in such a small location, it can make it pretty noisy for the customers. Pizza is tasty and the toppings are fresh and with a good amount of sauce and cheese. The crust is flaky and not too thick. Give Lino's a try."
"Another dimsum place in the area that has stepped up their insta-worthy game.

This place is my family's go to for early morning dimsum. The early morning special is cheap and the lines aren't as crazy as Dragon Boat. They have a few unique items on the menu and have been adding a lot of visually appealing dishes. It's sad that they removed weekend morning specials, but so did every other dimsum in the area so I can't blame them."
"Just waited 28 minutes for a""hot and ready"" 2 crazy breads and some wings.  And the wings were already ready.  There is no reason for this amount of wait time when I could see at least 3-4 employees in the back that should've been preparing."
I enjoy going to this IHOP location. Super crowded on Sunday mornings. Service is always great and friendly. Food is good - based on other IHOP locations I visited.
"The first time I've ever had something from here was when the bf brought me a kouign amann after work (the best!). And it was freaking delicious! I've had kouign amanns before in San Francisco where pastries are all the rage, and it's definitely comparable. It's hard to go wrong with a caramelized pastry with flaky layers. *insert heart eye emoji* 

I was randomly having a craving for mac and cheese for lunch and when I yelped it Squarz was the first thing that came up under the search results. So I decided to pre-order a few things from their website to pick up. 

- Mac n Cheese: You can add bacon to this for 0.50 cents but it honestly doesn't need it. The small size is perfect as a side since it's so rich. Definitely satisfied the craving. 
- Side Salad: I tried to get some greens to make myself feel less guilty about the mac n cheese. They actually ended up comping this for me since apparently it comes with other veggies such as cucumbers that they ran out of. Works for me! 
- Turkey, swiss, and garlic aioli squaressant sandwich: Pretty self-explanatory. The butter croissant bun was delicious and super flaky. Definitely the star ingredient. 
- Fresh squeezed lemonade: Really good! They give it to you in a huge cup too. Satisfies that sweet tooth.
- Kouign Amann: Yep, got another one. It might seem a bit pricey since it's $4 for one, but IT IS SO WORTH IT. Don't leave without getting one. Even though I was sooo full from trying a little bit of everything, I for sure had room to eat this. I repeat, CARAMELIZED croissant. How can that not be good???

They make ordering online really easy since their menu is displayed all on one easy-to-read page with photos. I really want to try one of their pies next time since that's what most people seem to get. Plus I have high expectations since they seem to do that flaky/delicious part of their bread so well. 

And if possible try to get your items take out since the store is reeeeeal small. You walk in and the counter is right there. It's basically a long hallway. They do have very limited seating (I think a couple inside and a few outside). Luckily it wasn't too busy when I stopped by so it is possible to eat there if you need to. Everyone there was very nice as well!"
"So you have dietary restrictions, not a problem at Cardinal Rule. They offer options for vegans, vegetarians and Celiacs. The menu has a great variety of foods that tease your palette. Do avoid the coffee, it is quite burnt but don't skip dessert, it's scrumptious."
This was an excellent dining experience. The chef came over and explained to us what to order and what our options were. The menu is very simple. Just ramen and beverages. The broth is lighter than other ramen I've had but still very flavorful. They also make their own chili sauce that adds a touch of spiciness and extra flavor.
"Holy cow, my cortado is sweet. I ordered a cortado because it is a good way to judge coffee quality, but I can't even taste the coffee because of how sweet it is. The agave nectar combined with the natural bitterness of the drink creates a really bad aftertaste.

To empathize with the shop, I know Starbucks ruined most customers' taste buds to expect sweetness with any drink but a black coffee. But seriously, don't make a hybrid. Be like Starbucks and make all your drinks into sweetened lattes or keep it original.

Customer service was good. Overall great atmosphere. And free wifi is great. I would be willing to give this place another chance if I needed a place to work, but I would likely order a latte next time and expect a Starbucks taste."
"Folks saw an ad in the newspaper for $1 dish Shanghai Dim Sum. So came here to try it out. The dim sum menu is not large. Mainly just soup filled steamed dumplings, Soy Bean Drinks, Green Onion Pancakes,Congees, & Fried Rice Cake.

So their $1 Dim Sum is only for the 1st Order only. After that it's $2.49 each and this is only for the Soup Filled Steamed Dumplings. Other items for the $1 are Soy Bean Drinks, Congee etc.

Some of the steamed dumplings were a bit dried on top, I assume some are made in advance because of the $1 deal. But still tasty regardless. 

Fried Rice Cake was interesting..shaped in a square shape and deeped fried. A bit oily but it was nice and crisp.

Their Sticky Rice Rolls and Pan Fried Dumplings are gigantic compared to other places. Again taste was not bad. 

Congee was a So So, their congee was not smooth and had whole grains of rice in it. 

Shanghai Fried Noodles, tasty but a bit too greasy."
"Terrible.  The shipment I was expecting was ""UNDELIVERABLE - NEED GATE CODE"".  UPS and FedEx have never had this problem at my condo.  I didn't even get a call requesting the gate code.  They simply did not deliver it today.  I now have to wait until Monday.  Amazon is going to lose cusotmers if they keep using OnTrac."
"I am super bummed to report that Brittingham Boats no longer serves grilled cheese!  4 stars because I'm so sad about this!

Other than that, it still remains one of my favorite places to spend a sunny afternoon. On top of their fun rental options they have also been expanding their options for special events. From ice cream floats, to full moon paddle events, and stand up paddle board yoga workshops there is always something fun happening at Brittingham Boats. 

Also, even if you're not interested in paddling it's still worth stopping by! They often have live music and a fire going. A nice place to spend time, for sure!"
"Never tried Sonic before. Got a double bacon cheeseburger and a chili cheese dog. Nothing that 'blew my mind'. I'm sure ill go there again, just won't go out of my way to do so."
"I visited Vera's with three of my bridesmaids, hoping to find the perfect dress. I had been dress shopping three times before and knew exactly what I wanted -- fabric, silhouette, etc. -- and I was ready to buy a dress. I had 10 Ben Franklins waiting in my purse (gotta hide the cost from the Mr.) I DID find the perfect dress at Vera's, but not because of my consultant or the service.

The appointment started out very dry and sanitary; I was half expecting the consultant to take a blood sample and check my blood pressure. No questions about how I wanted to feel in my dress, what I liked or didn't like, or about the general feel of the wedding. Instead, she asked a laundry list of impersonal questions. 

When I brought up that I had been dress shopping before and wanted a sweetheart neckline, mermaid or fit-and-flare silhouette, and rouching across the stomach, she dismissed my preferences and told me that my desire for a mermaid silhouette was ""impractical"" because many brides ""think they can pull it off, but really can't"" -- as if my 5'3"", 125 lb figure wouldn't be able to handle such a vampy cut.

She brought me two dresses to begin with. One was taffeta and pink, with assorted Swarovski crystals tacked on in a way that appeared as if someone mixed the beads with super glue and put them in the dryer with the dress. The cut wasn't flattering at all, and it was far from what I indicated that I liked. Moreover, I had already said that I didn't like taffeta because it looks like a windbreaker, and I wasn't planning on having my bridesmaids wear matching tracksuits or giant clocks around their necks. 

I wasn't happy after trying on the first dresses and she made no other suggestions. I had to ask her to bring me more dresses.  She finally brought me a dress that was $2000, twice the price point that I told her I wanted to stay under. Then, she preceded to pressure me into buying the dress because she said I would regret my decision if I didn't.

She also made some offhanded comment about how the factory workers who assemble and bead the veils they have make close to 48 cents an hour, which, according to her, isn't bad and it's enough to support a family! Who knew.

My bridesmaids were all in a huff by this point, and I was also fairly annoyed. I called out a ""Bridesmaids! Mush!""  and they took to the racks themselves. My sister pulled the perfect dress -- slight sweetheart, satin, mermaid, rouching, no beading -- and I knew it was the dress I would be married in the second I put it on. The the consultant's credit, she did suggest that I go to a room with natural light, as the wedding is outside, and then she was very meticulous in the ordering process. 

The consultant didn't bother to say goodbye or even give me her business card. My dress is gorgeous, and yes, short girls CAN pull of mermaid styles, and I look damn fantastic. 

I would not recommend Vera's to any bride or bridal party. I am hoping the service improves once my dress comes it. I don't know if I trust them to do my alterations."
"What can be better than a good American burger? Oh so many other things, kids, do not even tempt me into telling you. However lately  I've been trying to cultivate the love for burgers in me  the way some people try to stomach hummus or coconut milk. 
Because I really want to be bad in a good American way. I want to have a burger worth dying for. 
 B-spot did not contribute to my love whatsoever. Greasy, filling and not worth it in the end. Just like Five Guys.  Cocktails simply made a horrid impression on me - whoever mixes rootbeer floats with Maker's Mark, should be imprisoned for wasting good whiskey on such a bad experiment.
So looks like all of my attempts to die young and beautiful from coronary artery disease have been in vain. I am slowly but surely driving back to Suchi-land after multiple unsuccessful attempts to anchor at Burgarism. 
What a disgrace I am."
"Two stars only because the staff was friendly. My advice, do all you can to avoid Dr Frank Raia. Worst set of experiences I've had in the medical arena, and I've had a lot. 

He denied getting records that were verified by more than one other office, and told me he could make recommendations because he didn't have the info. He didn't evaluate me instead spent 20-30 seconds evaluating me. 

When he sent me for two tests and one was canceled, he said a follow up wasn't necessary. He is extremely inefficient and has absolutely no regard for his patients. I had to continue seeing him based on a recommendation from my lawyer for a personal injury case, otherwise I'd never have gone back. I could go on with more specifics, but I'll spare you. Take my advice an GO ELSEWHERE!"
"Love this place. Atmosphere was warm and inviting, food was delicious, and beer was cheap and tasty. The juicy Sheridan Sandwich and perfectly balanced Red Goat salad are my recommendations. Restaurant feels like a perfect place to visit on the regular basis, because it is enough sophisticated, yet definitely laid back. You guys got one regular customer, already."
"Came back tonight cos, well I'm stupid.

Ordered take out. As I was waiting, the sushi chef prepared another customer's order and not once, but twice, ate some of the fish out of his fingers and then proceeded to continue preparing the sushi without washing his hands.

Spicy salmon maki with a side of saliva. 

Gross. Definitely not coming back now."
"Met up at this small rustic looking chill honey comb hideout last night with some friends, i had already eaten so i just indulged in a specialty craft drink. Placed a order for the spicy booty loop drink.Was quite tasty but not $14 tasty. The looks of this place i do love as well as the laid back scene with old school music and more mature crowd.Their was one small problem my friend as she was drinking her drink she had a grey goose mixed with vodka she found a hair in it as she was drinking it the waitress did bring her out another one and apologized. Look forward to seeing what the actual dishes are like."
"One of the best restaurants I've eaten in - I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service. I only wish I lived closer!"
Been coming here for years. They have a great selection of gels and I like how they do both pedicures and manicures at the same time.
"First of all, the restaurant is located on the ground floor of an office building.  This was previously a Japanese restaurant as well.  The on-site parking lot is paid parking operated by Impark, so you have to pay even if it is at night.  This is a distinct disadvantage when compared to other restaurants in the area, as evident by only a few customers on a weeknight.  
  
As for the food, the tempera was very well done and the salmon was very fresh.  However, other than that, it is nothing special in a market that is saturated with sushi restaurants.  I had higher expectations with the reviews I have read.  The sashimi for example is normally accompanied by daikon garnish that is edible in other restaurants is absent here... definitely unusual. The sushi rice was nothing special... good nigiri sushi is defined by the rice. Service is good and we were looked after well.  All in all this is a decent choice for sushi but there are better ones out there in the market.  Solid 3.5 Stars out of 5."
"I've been to Tammie Coe a couple times as I live fairly close to this location. They have some pretty delish baked goods.... I've tried the crack cake (chocolate and mocha deliciousness), red velvet cupcake (cream cheesy frosting of wonderfullness... but hard to eat due to the top being larger than the base and all of the sprinkles), Ooey gooey cupcake (ummm yum!), and the brownie (just ok...way too much frosting). Overall, I don't think this is the most delicious dessert in town, but it is very good and I would (obviously) go back."
"This is the most perfect manifestation of the corporate restaurant. The clean decor, almost unbelievably extensive menu, and well trained servers make it a potential destination for virtually every American. The service is good and the food is decent, with huge American portions. There is nothing to complain about but also nothing distinctive. Prices are on the high side given the quality, but not high enough to drive the customers away. It's much more acceptable for lunch than dinner."
I guess cuz I stayed here for 5 hrs I'll give it 5 stars cuz my son just don't want to leave. I love the massage chairs. Definitely helped me cuz I'm always in pain. Being pregnant and all.
"First time trying King's Fish House for lunch and had high expectations going in. Unfortunately, it didnt quite live up to what we were hoping for.

I had Angel hair pasta with shrimp with a cup of New England clam chowder soup, my mom ordered the grilled catfish, and my sister got the seabass. They also had sides of fries,  spinach, and corn (see pictures). We were also served some bread at beginning of our meal.

None of these dishes quite stood out. Clam chowder was yummy and not overly salty - just how I like it. My pasta dish and my mom's catfish were just A-Ok.. but the seabass was the biggest let down.  Lacked flavor and had a very tough texture.

Staff was friendly and the seating area outside was nice (we lucked out that day with warm weather).  But im not sure if I'll make another visit."
"Sam Woo, my favorite Chinese BBQ restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley.  Where else can I go for some good Cha Siu (BBQ Pork), Si Yuo Ji (Soy Sauce Chicken), etc.  So when I saw the LV location when we're driving around looking for a place to eat, I was definitely interested.

Going in, it looked the same as the LA locations, as is the ""Cash Only"" sign.  Being an expert of Chinese food in the SGV (Most are cash only) and being in Vegas, my friends and I carried plenty of cash.  We ordered a few dishes: Ping Pan (A mix of a few different BBQ), Lo Mein, Fried Rice, and a few stir-fry dishes.  The food was OK, I mean pretty much tasted the same as the ones in LA, so I had no complaints.  My only complaint was why did they jack up the prices by $2-3/per dish??  I mean in Vegas, the real estate is cheaper than LA, so are the gas prices, what's the need for a Lo Mein dish being $9?  Then, I remembered the Banana Cream Pie I had at Emril's in MGM being $9, so I guess this was a steal!  If you're sick of Buffets and in the mood for Chinese food, this is a decent location."
"So 10 days after this review posted, Michelle called and let me know that there was a problem with their phone system and let me know that if we still needed the work done (we do) to give her a call.  She was very cordial.  I am so glad that she followed up and that no big tragedy happened!"
"delicious, great service, was extremely busy and we still got a table, prompt & delicious food, the Guacamole is yummy and made fresh in front of you! Of course you must try the Tequila."
"Coffee smells great and tasted even better!!! LOVED the challah bread french toast.  My friend and I shared the apple with brandy and it was simply the best EVER!!!!  It's HUGE and so tasty with coffee that it made our day!  The bacon was cooked perfectly (crispy, not greasy, smoky, hickory, sweet/tangy) and liked the eggs too.  

Great place for breakfast!!!!  They also have a firepit with great seating outside.  Too bad it was a bit chilly but we enjoyed eating inside and looking out the windows.  Lots of natural light and friendly staff."
"I could not be more proud to have Kim as my stylist.  Her salon is sophisticated, chic, warm and friendly.  Her ultimate goal is to provide the desired outcome for her clients.  Kim - feels like family!!"
"Ordered a chicken  teriyaki bowl. The chicken was hard , at least I think it was chicken. It was uneatable . Either it was way overcooked or way over breaded. It had sort of woody texture. Had to throw it away. I will be hesitant to return."
"Got my nose pierced here last night. Granted, they have some amazing body jewelry here. But the piercer and front room lady were extremely rude and rushing. They both seemed to want to rush out of there (which I can understand since, ya know.... Work). But the piercer especially was pushy, rude, sarcastic and unwelcoming. If I hadn't paid first I wouldn't have gotten the piercing as there was no level of comfort or trust."
"DO NOT GET YOUR POLICY WITH THEM. Worst customer service, they never seem to be able to help and just keep telling you need to call another department which when I call tells me the same. Endless calls and waste of time. I would give them 0 if it was possible. Unfortunately I found out after I played my policy that they also have the worst ratings of all. Take your money somewhere else."
"Great ambiance as expected from the owners reputation as restauranteurs, Sunday brunch menu, had the infamous buttermilk fried chicky samich, great brioche bun, chicken slightly dry, cole slaw good but needed more zinggg, dressing like a Dijon honey mustard. Overall a good samich but needed a bit more pizazz... And I was still hungry after so I ordered the New England fry w/ calamari, legs, and Ipswich clams (east coast full bellied sandy clams)... Some clams were a bit chewy, should be plump n tender, had blistered shishito peppers, a plus! Love those thangs!!!
Full licquor bar with few drafts, Scrimshaw a plus! 

I was really looking forward to loving this place but value came up short,  small portions, the ideas are great, but the flavors fall a bit short... A little salt goes a long way but its in the name not the food...  The shishito peppers were the best part....

C"
"The place is unpretentious, sincere and serves amazing food.  what more can you ask for?"
"Auto share is now blaming my husband and I for damage we did not do. And bullying us into making a claim, they will not get off out backs and threatening that we will eb charged if we don't put the claim in......... so out of here!"
"i go every month to labcorp for my blood test. never an issue. 

here i did one blood test and well the picture speaks louder than words.

note im a pretty happy camper with mostly 5 stars kind of guy."
"This place is wildly overpriced. $10 for a regular sized shawarma sandwich is one of the most expensive shawarma prices in Toronto.

The beef shawarma tasted like it was covered in lime juice. There was no other flavour because the lime was too powerful. It was so sour and awful that I will never be trying this place again."
The tea and the food is good. They sell glass milk bottles and mason jars to put your tea in and even replacement lids for the mason jars. BUT THEY WILL NOT REFILL THE MASON JARS! In Nevada this is not a healthcode violation to use a personal or reusable cup in a tea or coffee shop. They waste a plastic cup by giving you that so you have to make a mess and transfer it yourself. Total waste!
"Carne Asada Burrito was pretty good to the last bite, ingredients even throughout.  Only wish it was bigger, but I value quality over quantity.  2 thumbs up!"
"Over the years we have eaten here many times only because we really do love the stir fry bar.  I just love stir fry and being able to pick the exact veggies and sauce you want is great.  The food has always been great.  I will say that a ""salad bar"" situation usually creeps me out because of the cleanliness and freshness, but their veggie bar is always clean and food is fresh.  

But I can't give more stars because of the sporadic service and cleanliness.  So it's ironic that I find the food bar clean but the rest of the restaurant looks so dirty!!!  And the bathrooms are horrid and about 100 degrees!! 

There's one female server we try to avoid because she's so bad.  Today we had an attentive server but she was such a airhead. 

But I'm sure we'll be back because we do love the food. 

By the way, they do have ""kids food"" for the little ones so that's nice."
"The wait was long. They told us 1.5 hrs. But was more like 2.75 hrs. Bar staff was nice, hence the 3 stars"
"I liked this place a lot. I had the steak fajitas and they were great. Brought to your table in traditional fajita fan-fare they were tasty, juicy, and the quantity was perfect. My only negatives are that the fajitas had a TON of bell peppers and onions (disproportionately so to the steak) and the refried beans had no flavor whatsoever. Honestly these two things didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying my meal. I will definitely be back."
"Sometimes at the little places, like inside the hotel, these kind of Starbucks places are more like the red headed step child of the others. I can confidently say this location fits in with the rest of the family.

They have all the favorites and classics. And they are open 24 hours! 

If I am staying at the Westin again, I will certainly be stopping in for an overpriced, high caloric coffee that Starbucks is known for."
"This is a review of the service department, specifically in regard to Drive Clean testing. There are several Drive Clean testing facilities in the area and I have been to a few over the years -- Canadian Tire and Mr Lube. This is by far the nicest and fastest facility that I've visited, mainly because it's also a dealership. I came in at 10am for a Drive Clean test without an appointment and left within the hour. While waiting for service, I helped myself to free coffee, free chocolate chip cookies, and free wifi. There are also charging adapters for your devices. It has all of the Apple-specific adapters as well as some of the older Android adapters, but does not have USB-C.

In terms of convenience and cleanliness, this is my recommended place to go for your Drive Clean testing needs."
"Make sure to catch ""Johnny Devil and the Screaming Demons"" live every Tuesday night at around 10pm. Probably the only regular live musical act  in Bloor West Village as far as I know. They're a really perfect bar band to listen to over a pitcher. They have a really good selection of beers on tap, but it's all very pricey. The burgers are great, and it's not a bad deal considering the quality and uniqueness of the burgers, plus the fact that you get a tasty side. The waitstaff are nice, but not as friendly as I prefer. I'll be looking forward to the next time I pop in to hear Johnny and the demons again!"
"Ok food, wait staff was really nice though as were  the hosts. Lots of variety of food, some good some missed the mark. Prime rib was the best thing there when I was there."
"I love the pumpkin bread !! Sooo good!!
Chocolate cookies to die for ! 
Thank for making fresh bread daily"
"This is THE place to go for a weekend brunch while in Vegas.  Sitting outside by the pool is awesome, especially when the weather is primo.  This is our ""go-to"" place when Booth, Bloewen, Buxton, and myself hit up the fabulous city of Las Vegas.  The food is great, it is all served to your table, and you can basically try the entire menu.  The real treat is the all you can drink mimosas during breakfast.  They have about 15 different flavors, and of course we had to try them all.  Buxton's favorite was by far the prickly pear.

We've had a lot of great memories over the years having brunch at the Border Grill.  Service is always nice, and they are more than friendly dealing with our shenanigans of heavy drinking.  After trying numerous champagne brunches in Vegas, this is my favorite spot when the weather is tolerable.  

Prices are slightly on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for.  This is a brunch place that is a ""must visit"" on each trip to the ""City that never sleeps."""
They treat their locals like crap I used to love coming here until the staff changed especially the bouncers they're the rudest most stupid people I've ever met I'm going to Oddfellows
"Excellent experience as always. I always stop by at least once when in Vegas.... 
Ordered the turkey burger and smores and both were amazing. Service was great, never had to wait long for anything. Bar staff attentive and environment was lively. I will be going back."
"Service: very good when they are with you, but we were served by several people and had to wait for quite some time even to get the drinks (even in a peak hour it could have been faster, but this is due to a number of servers, not the actual servers).

Food: my wife had a pasta dish, which was slightly fatter than it could have been, but otherwise very good. I had a steak, which was wonderful, but they served it with french fries. Really?! I paid $40 for it! Very inappropriate combination.

Desert was simply divine: we had a cherry pie and I have never had such an excellent cherry pie.

Noise: a bit noisy, some separators from the casino would help, but otherwise the atmosphere was very nice."
"Their  Bruchetta was really great!  Pasta was nice too, but wine selection was so-so.  I like this restaurant for sure."
"I purchased a groupon 2 services for $65. I called and scheduled my appointment for the following day at 10 am. When I arrived at 9:50 the front office staff had me go to the waiting area and fill out the paperwork- 15 minutes later she came in and told me the girl who was going to do my massage was running a few minutes late. The girl did not come until 10:35- once in the room I undressed and got under the sheet that didn't look very fresh. While the girl was giving me the massage her phone was ringing and going off several times, I could hear the microwave going off and the smell of food while getting the massage.The massage was basically just a rub and I kept asking her to use more pressure- it was so bad that I almost just asked her to stop half way through the massage. When it was over the girl took me to the front office and they asked how everything was and I told them not that great and the girl at the front said ok thank you..... It was very disappointing and makes me not want to even go back for the rest of my groupon. 

I also had extension put in a few years ago and the girl did a nice job but didn't say anything the entire time she put them in except insulting the texture of my hair."
"I hesitate to give 1 star but I would really love to. I'm giving 2 stars because the girl who actually checked me out was nice and the Vet tech was nice and handled my cat with care. I'm going to be honest this visit started out on a sour note. My cat had been acting weird and her fur had gotten gross/matted etc. Obviously something was wrong with her and I didn't have a current Vet so I called the closest one to me. They got me in that afternoon which was awesome (another reason for an extra star), however nothing really good came after that. I left work early and went to wrangle my cat into her carrier, ended up at the office early. So I sat to wait. Two of the women who sit at the front desk were disgusting people. Seriously the older women sat up there and talked crap about every single person who called or walked in. I mean hateful vile crap... I was horrified that an establishment would allow such behavior. They are nice as can be to people's face (sort of) but the minute they walk out or hang up it's just cattiness at it's worst. I absolutely almost walked out right then. My appt. was at 4 and they called me back about 415-420 at that point I'd been there for 45 minutes or so listening and watching them be catty. The vet tech comes in and I warn her that my cat doesn't like to be held etc. so she suggests they wait for the Dr. So the Dr comes in and honestly I felt like she didn't know much about cats. She kept looking at me like I was crazy when explaining what was going on with my cat. Basically treated me like I was wasting her time and all she kept saying was wow I wouldn't expect her to be so strong and fast at her age. In process of getting my cat to the vet her tooth came out this obviously, must have been what was wrong with her as she's better now (you'd think the Dr would have mentioned that as a possible source of issue). The Dr. said do we have your permission to do blood work, urine sample etc. I agreed to it as I truly wanted to know what was wrong with her. They said they'd call me back the next day with the results... so I got a call from a different Doctor who said well she has some elevations here and there but nothing definitive and well we can't really tell anything. If you want to bring her back you can but not much we can do or tell. Basically they knew NOTHING, not even a small indication of what could be wrong. Honestly I felt like they wasted my time and my money to tell me absolutely nothing, and to do absolutely nothing. Well I guess the only good thing from this office visit was that my cat lost her tooth and appears to be feeling soo much better, her fur is already starting to brighten up etc. 

Sorry sooo long but my suggestion to anyone looking for a Vet's office is to avoid this one. I got no sense of security in them caring for my pets, I didn't feel they were knowledgeable and any office or Doctors who would let those two women be the face of their customer service and support obviously have issues. Those women were the most awful people I have met in a long time!!"
"I got their pulled pork sandwich. It was pretty good. I had their pulled pork with a plate of meat at another location and it was the best meat of all of them. The bread was nice and soft and a bit toasted around the edges. The barbecue sauce they gave me was good. The macaroni was OK. I've had better. My only problem with them is that the person at the front completely ignored me, so I thought I was in the wrong place to order. I soon figured out it was the right place, but she kept ignoring me while just chopping meat. The other workers didn't seem to like their jobs. I don't think I would return to this location."
"Woah, ignore that last review.  If you need to shop at Jared, go to the Strongsville location.

One of my wife's eternity band wedding rings needed repair work.  We originally brought the ring to the North Olmsted location to have it rhodium dipped and serviced.  The person working the counter was very nice and inspected the ring.  She told me one of the diamonds had a crack and would need to be replaced.  I didn't know diamonds could crack, but sure, it's covered under the service plan so I'm not concerned.  They shipped the ring out to be repaired.  A couple weeks later I got a call that they found another chipped diamond and it would be a couple more weeks.  Fine with me.  Then it finally came back and that's where the problems really started.

I went to pick up the ring and the man helping me was quite odd.  He kept looking past me as he talked, watching the other employees across the room like a hawk.  As if they were going to seal something.  It was a very odd interaction.  The ring looked shiny, so I was happy.  I didn't fully inspect the rings when I picked them up (that's my screw-up).  My wife, on the other hand, looked at her ring and noticed crooked diamonds, tool marks, and gaps around a section of four diamonds that would collectively be enough to hold a full diamond.  We had this ring re-sized a while ago and spent $200 to make sure there were no gaps from the re-sizing.  Someone repairing this screwed up and didn't bother to replace the second cracked diamond.  

My wife took the ring back and she was told that the ring was in this poor condition when we first brought it in for service.  They said they take pictures of all incoming rings and it looked like this beforehand (no one pulled up the picture or looked at the picture while she was at the store).  That's interesting because I have the records of a recent full appraisal that shows the ring in great condition.  The employee at the store just made up excuses for why it would have looked so screwed up beforehand and didn't care to help us or even hear us out.  They told her to just wear the ring so the damage wouldn't face upwards.  WTF kind of service is that?  I've spent a good amount of cash at Jared, but when my wallet isn't out on the counter service seems to take a huge dive.

My wife took the ring to the Strongsville store since we've had great experiences at that particular store in the past.  The store manager looked at the ring and said he would never let a ring leave his shop looking so poor.  He was shocked to know that a Jared store would have given the ring to a customer given our past service history (the record shows that the ring would have never been in such poor condition, and if it were, they would have had to fix it under the service plan).  He immediately realized that either someone did a very bad job repairing the ring, or a diamond fell out of its setting, which is covered under the service plan.  But given the odd spacing and the tool marks, he new that the repair work was the problem.  So what does the Strongsville store manager do?  He makes it right and does what North Olmstead should have done in the first place.  He took the ring and sent it right back to the repair shop.  He then apologized for our poor experience.  Moral of the story, don't go to the North Olmstead store if you want to shop at Jared."
"Compared to other malls, Southpark has a lot of different stores and dining options. Always super busy. Supposedly, this mall has a high personal theft rate, ex. people stealing purses, breaking in i cars, etc. I've never had a problem though. Clean as well."
"(3.5 stars)

Firefly serves the purpose if you're looking for an alternative away from the strip and want a casual bite to eat. There are PLENTY of options on the menu to keep everyone happy!  

On our plate - 
* Veggie Empanada - crisp, flaky and flavorful.
* Warm Spinach Salad - with artichoke, red pepper, pine nuts, feta and a dash of lemon. The slightly warmed up spinach gave the salad a nice body and the addition of pine nuts added a great crunch. 
* Baked Goat Cheese - can't really go wrong with baked cheese! Ever. This was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth delicious.
* Shrimp in lemon garlic butter sauce - the sauce was good, but the shrimp did not absorb any of it and seemed to be tossed in it a few minutes right before serving.
* Grilled octopus - very disappointing, the octopus was chewy and didn't taste fresh at all...the sauce lacked seasoning as well. 

Service was friendly and efficient."
"Ok, so I love the servers and the atmosphere....and I used to love the menu. Im so sad they have changed the menu. I used to get the turkey sandwich on a pretzel bun, but now it is brioche, and it has changed the taste of the entire sandwich. It was a total disappointment!!! No VigAz burger either! Please change it back...this is a bummer. Ill come for drinks, but Im not crazy about the changes on the menu."
"The decor was great! Nice cozy feel. It not a big venue but they do have an outdoor patio. I did try one of there craft drink, Ferdinand Friend. The drink was very strong which is a plus but small in size. I prefer the Calamari which had a great flavor. Great portion size as well for it to be a small plate. Overall like the experience."
"What a sad waste of our time. We tried this place for the teppan grill experience as a family. It was bonus that we got a Groupon, so we gave it a try. 
It was Friday night, So I made reservations for 7p.

We got there at 6:50p. We walked in and stood at the door looking for a hostess. NO ONE came up to us or greeted us for first 9 minutes. We sat down on the front bench next to door/register waiting to flag down someone. The restaurant was not packed. We finally grabbed a server and said, ""sorry, can we get seated to eat please!?"" The girl said, ""oh you do you have reservations? "" I replied, ""yeah for 7p"". It was now 7:20p. She said okay. Another family walked in and then we got seated at 7:37p..

Finally we got seated and were grateful to finally get to eat. The restaurant was dirty. There was rice on the ground and chairs. The music was loud and ready for a rave. 

We got our orders in: two chicken teppan dinners and scallop dinner. The chef was great, seemed to know what he was ddd doing. The food was incredibly disappointing.  The soup was more cloudy and salty than usual miso soup, salad had plopped spoonful of ginger dressing on top.  Fried rice was good, although we were charged $3.00 each more. The Asian server was taking our order and was like, ""you want fried rice, right?"" So we replied, ""yes"". Lol too funny.
Well it was sad, because each person that ordered chicken ended up ALL having dry chicken. In the end I told the server, she got very upset and walked away. Then she came back a minute later and said, ""I wanna try your chicken. Can I?"", as she was already reaching her fork to the plate. She chewed it and walked away again. She did come back and deduct one chicken kids meal off which was nice. But overall. ....do not go."
"Good and bad. My favorite Forever 21 for shopping and accessories but the employees at this one suck. It's impossible to find someone to help you because they're all walking around with their nose in the air. Trying on is always a nightmare with a huge line. They won't let you bring and friend back to wait so you can show them your try ons and help choose. Oh, and its hard to forget that the fitting room walls are covered in boogers and smeared makeup. 

Needs friendlier staff and a good cleaning."
"Mine and my sister and brother in law experience of metro pizza was opposite of the the experience I had with my best friend. First me and my best friend came in first and ate around 7pm we had a calzone and garlic knots and wine service and food great. My sister and brother in law had not eat dinner yet and I told them how good the food was so they asked me to join the so we all came at 915pm ready to eat more good food, the service was good and great food again but this time when we go up to leave several male employees in the bar area where fat shaming us by barking and mooing at us we looked at each other is disbelief and when we looked back they where pointing at us. Bottom line this is disrespectful and we will not be back and I have enjoyed metro pizza for over 30 plus years!"
"Pretty big place that has great food! I'd say that this place is better than the Golden Nugget Buffet that I went to on the other night. This buffet is so much cheaper like only $6 or $7 and has a variety of delicious foods. I literally stuffed my gut until I couldn't anymore because everything looked so good especially the desserts :] 

I think this buffet was voted the best buffet in Downtown Las Vegas! ( It's on a billboard somewhere :P) You should definitely give it a try if you're in the downtown area! Just a short walk from the Fremont Street Experience."
"Terrible! We were so excited to try this place and all 3 of us were way underwhelmed. The server was nice and yet it still gets a 1 star. Had the Greek salad which was so gross, I couldn't stomach it. When my sister tried it her reaction was the same. How can you mess up greek salad? My husband and sister ordered the fish tacos and they were so bland and boring that they both just kinda went, ""uh."" We also tried the pepperoni wrapped pretzels that were super gross and the cheese sauce, while ok, was so salty when combined with the pretzels it was almost inedible. The fries appetizers were so tiny, thin cut, nasty and looked and tasted so cheap; and yet surprise, they were expensive!!! After spending $100 for lunch for 3 people (no liquor or desserts) we expected to really like at least one item but we were all very disappointed and didn't really care for any...and this is coming from the least picky eaters ever. Way better places out there! Try The Social House if you happen to like Japanese...it's way cheaper (don't let the fancy outside detour you) and all 6 of us were amazed at how good it was! Another one we tried in Vegas was Goodwich. Yes, it's a little scary on the outside and it's kind of a hot dog stand type set up that sells sandwiches but WOW, Amazing sandwiches!!! The 3 of us fell in love! Do yourself a favor and try anywhere else but here."
"As this was our fourth time going we already knew what to expect! It was my husband and my 1 year wedding anniversary and there was no other romantic place that we could choose from. 

We are both Vegan so we knew that we would be getting amazing food. 

That was not the case, the hostess asked if this was a special occasion and we did mention that it was our anniversary but there was no acknowledgement of our anniversary. 

We were cool with that because we are a same sex couple and we understand how people may react. We were also shocked how the bottle service was going to be $35 which is more expensive than the bottle of wine they served. That should have been our first sign of actually leaving. 

When the waitress came up from she made a comment with a small attitude about so you call me up here for a two topper but there are multiple two topper which one is mine. 

The waitress provided wonderful service but it didn't make up for the sub par quality of food. 

The first entree the waitress went ahead and said you may have already had this which we did, and I was already disappointed. We know that the menu changes every couple of months and the last time we went was back in August 2017. 2nd entree was very disappointing as if the restaurant didn't know what to do so they just scrapped a couple of things together and served. The third entree they used gardein products and I was extremely disappointed as prior time they were able to put together a meal and make it delicious and having us use are palette. 

The fourth entree was ok as it wasn't anything to fancy. The fifth entree was definitely a huge disappointment as the veggies were under cooked and the starch was over cooked and the fake meat once again came up again. The dessert came and it was good. The first and last dish was probably the only thing I real enjoyed at the restaurant .

Upon paying my bill I was extremely shocked that the price went up another $20 per person which I do understand that if it's a high demand restaurant that you gotta do what you gotta do but at least make the meal worth $80 per person. I don't think I will be coming back again."
"I have visited many different Winking Lizards and they seem to be all very similar but distinct. This location was nice because of the great location, ergo, there were a lot of crowds here though. None-the-less I got there with a friend around 7pm and we were immediately sat which was nice. With only two people it is not impossible to get seated immediately at peak times of course but there is always that chance. I digress. The menu is pleasing to anyone as it has a lot of the more 'comforting/safe' foods like burgers, chicken items, fries, wings, etc. So you are bound to find something that you like and if you are trying to lose the lbs, they have lighter options as well. My friend got those because although she is already thin, she cannot take the chance of a burger, lord forbid. I digress. The burger and fries I got had a great portion size, a bit more than you can find anywhere but overall I was impressed since chains don't seem to give up the extras. The crowds were certainly there and there were many large groups hanging about making noise. The staff was on point and had recommendations of course if you were to inquire about them. Not a bad place to go after work or whenever you feel."
"Went back with a close friend with a small appetite, ordered ribs we were going to split.  Told them not to split it  You can't share your food unless you pay $4.  Didn't want 2 plates or anything else.  Was charged the $4 and given the stuff anyway - house rule I'm told.  Order your food to go then just sit down and eat it, I guess.  Seriously?"
I just love this place.  Everyone there is so nice and they are all great at what they do!  I find the atmosphere so relaxing and the prices are so fair.  Kari is the best at keeping me looking young!
"EDIT:
Paul reached out to, and all issues were addressed !! Thanks, Paul !

This review is for the Henderson location. I could have sworn I submitted a review when it happened, but it somehow disappeared. Weird. Anyways, I heard the Vegas location is much better. /shrug

I had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.

The other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.

Now somebody rear ended me, and guess what, the insurance company wants to send me there. There's not a snowball's chance in hell I ever have them touch any of my cars again."
"We came here for dinner after a long day of traveling. It's our first time in Phoenix and a friend had suggested checking this place out, so we did. The inside looks great- modern, clean, very large. A bit noisy but hey, it's Saturday night. I went with the fish tacos while my boyfriend stuck to his usual burger and, as we usually do, we split halfsies. The burger was tasty, though nothing spectacular- worth the price. The tacos were pretty bland- not much flavor and they only give you two in corn tortillas with a small wedge of avocado in esch. Not worth the $17 what so ever, and I'm usually not one to complain. The staff was friendly, the place is a fun spot to be at, but be sure to choose your plates wisely."
"Very cute store. Was overly excited, but extremely disappointed. The flavors were lacking and taste similar to bake goods that come from grocery stores. Taste artificial. I was highly not impressed. $46 for a dozen cupcakes, 6 macarons, & 2 brownies! I'm most disappointed in the macarons. They don't taste anything like the true French macarons. Also, they are the size of your palm?! Basically a sand which cookie is more like it with powdered sugar frosting. Everything is overly sweet. Diabetic overload. If you don't have diabetes- you will from here.."
"Really good school, smart and talented kids. However, diversity in tech is sadly lacking. How do we fix this and balance this so that those born in this country also have the opportunity to attend such a good school as well?"
"I've been in here a few times for soccer cleats and the service has always been somewhat mediocre. Most of the time someone gets us the shoes and we don't see them again for a while to see if things fit or we need anything else. Today was terrible. We walked in and the place was pretty dead. Just a few customers in the whole store. I asked the only person on register if someone could help me with shoes. Obviously he could not leave the register. He overhead paged someone to shoes. After about 5 mins I returned to him and he overhead paged again. Still no one five minutes later. With this being a rather popular sporting goods store for the area I would expect much better service. As I said, the store was dead. We waited maybe 10-15 mins without any service. Very displeased."
"First visit I waited 30 minutes for a cup of coffee, had to ask twice for water. A couple at another table waited so long for a server to take their order, they finally gave up, ordered some cupcakes at the counter and left. My food was good, bought some cupcakes to take with me, they were delicious. Was really disappointed in the service but once our order was in, the kitchen was pretty quick, so we chalked it up to a bad day. Service was friendly, just slow, understaffed.

Went back this weekend, hostess warns us that the service might be slow. Not ""we had 2 servers call in sick so we're a little short-staffed today."" We asked what that meant and she just mumbled again about being slow and didn't really articulate herself. There was a couple of larger groups but a few open tables and no one on the patio. We decided to sit and the hostess went over and asked a server to come by our table, that was nice but if that's not the standard deal - a server coming by pretty soon after sitting down - yikes. Server was really friendly, took our oder (we put food in right away) but she never brought water even though she asked if we wanted any, after being there 20 minutes and well after we had coffee, I finally got up and helped myself to the disposable cups. Food took 45 minutes. We regretted not grabbing tacos and moving on with our Sunday afternoon.

Being the celiac in the family, it sucks to ask people to go to the ONE place you can eat super safe and always get bad service and have it be a poor experience for them. They give two shits it's gluten-free, to them it's the cafÃƒÂ© that's always slow (and apparently it's so bad the hostess tries to warn you).  I'll go back only when I'm by myself, I have my computer and can spend an hour and a half getting lunch. Or, will pop in for baked goods at the counter. Why not have enough servers to cover the tables you have? I guess they have a captive, niche audience."
"We've used other Discount Tire locations to buy tires in the past, but after this experience we might even rethink that. We bought new wheels for my vehicle. The store did not have them in stock, so had to order them from an out of state location. Not only did they lie to us about having ordered them, the salesman we used, Terry, seemed to go out of his way to avoid us when we would call to try to track down our order.

Eventually when the wheels did come in, one of them was damaged. We were told they would order a replacement and after waiting a week and being avoided by Terry even more, we discovered the replacement wheel was never ordered. And despite charging us more for black lug nuts, they never even bothered to order them until my fiance asked why they were putting chrome ones on my car. Then this was another appointment and more hassle to get back down to the shop.

Save your money and go somewhere else. It will be less stressful. Or just try not to get Terry if you do wind up having to go here."
"This place needs to decide if it is a bar or fine dining. Bar decor, rooftop deck with live music. Good food for the most part our table of 4loved the shrimp and grits and trout. Salmon was just okay.
The real problem was that on a friday night at least, the noise level and service were very much bar, ballantyne watering hole. If that is what you want, this is your place"
"The first couple of times I came here last year, the energy was high, the food was great and I left with a smile on my face! But the last few times I visited, the employees genuinely seem tired and overworked, resulting in lesser quality/unsatisfying bowls."

"I normally am weary of recommending mechanics to people, since I am someone who has been the brunt of bad mechanic stories in multiple states.  I had a bad experience a few years back at Desert Nissan, and my beautiful baby (I am referring to my car haha) had some issues so Eric R. asked a coworker who recommended Madrid's Pit Stop.

I went there with around 4 problems back in September and everything got fixed for $90!  I was floored.  I had been expecting up to $1000!  Well, after another oil change at Terrible's, I was told my brakes were suspect.  Driving in the tunnel to go to work freaked me out with bad brakes, so I started to take surface streets.  Eric R. had Columbus Day off and made his way in my car to Madrid's.  They told him to come back at a less busy time, so he was able to go back to his car, take it to his dealership, then get mine and take it back to Madrid's.  The front two brakes were all that needed fixin', and they took care of it in about 2 hours for a reasonable price.

I would go back here because they are really honest and affordable, and my car has not had any crazy problems since I left (and previous mechanics including those at Desert Nissan seemed to create new problems so I would have to come back for more work).  I am still afraid to drive in the tunnel but at least I can stop suddenly if need be!"
"Quand tu rentres quelque part et qu'il y a une line up de malade, en gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral tu sais que ÃƒÂ§a va ÃƒÂªtre bon!
Prendre mon mal en patience pour manger quelque chose d'aussi bon, aucun problÃƒÂ¨me! Les portions sont plus que gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©reuses pour le prix! Et le personnel est vraiment chill! 
J'adore!"
Way too crowded for it's small size. Have to wait 20 minutes for a drink while you are being suffocated by so many bodies. The only escape is the small outdoor area where you are again crammed in. The place looks nice but I'm not about waiting that long for drinks while sweaty bodies press up against me.
I had a Nexus 5 that was having problems with the power button. Took it in and they took a look. Turns out there was some debri behind the power button. They fixed it in a matter of minutes and didn't charge me. Wonderful service!
"So no idea why the ratings are poor for this place. I left feeling super satisfied.  I went yesterday with a friend that recommended them, she told me Scott was the man to see and he didn't disappoint.  He HOOKED me up with a whole new setup. I mean everything from explaining parts to me like I was five and assembling it too!  I'm what you'd call a Vape rookie.  He answered all my questions, really seemed to know his stuff.  He was honest with me about quality of certain products.  They have a frequent liquid card, thought that was pretty cool.  You can make your flavors and try them out, no problem. Tucker was helpful too. Professional dudes there that like to have fun."
"Smashburger was really good a couple years ago.

The meat is too thin now, too greasy, overcooked and over-seasoned. It still tastes good.

The prices are a bit too high for what you get."
I love this place! Great food and friendly service. Lunch specials are affordable and really delicious. Employees always have smile on their faces
"I had a procedure done today at this location & it was what I honestly describe as 'traumatic'. I am an anxious person by nature - toss in a procedure where I have to be sedated, and it has the potential to get bad. The situation at this office multiplied it by 1000. 

Like some of the other reviews, it's not due to the doctor - Dr. LaTowsky is wonderful & the only reason I trekked out here from Mesa. The rest of the staff & the office are the issue.

9:20 appointment, I was not seen until 10:45ish. That's inexcusable. Waiting room was full of other patients - it was obvious they way over scheduled. Their Scottsdale office has a pleasant, sleek waiting room with some ambiance. This office is sterile & cold.

I'm finally called back & have an IV put in. Then, I'm left sitting in an 80* exam room for another HOUR. I was getting very upset between the insane wait times + not having eaten in 12 hours + general nerves about the procedure. I'm sitting there stuck to an IV pole, unable to go anywhere, which was very unhelpful as well. When I expressed my frustration with the situation to the nurse who popped in, she spoke to me like a child, just saying ""Ok, write a letter"". 

(Oh, by the way, your ride is not allowed to leave and come back. The front desk girl said he was fine to do so, but then the nurse told him he couldn't leave the building. So my poor partner was trapped there as well.)

At NOON they finally came for me. The 'operating room' was horrifying. It looks like a storage room that just happened to have enough space for a bed. 

I had a small rash that appeared after the IV had been put in, and upon asking the anesthesiologist if it was an allergic thing from the IV, he just said ""Probably. You're going to sleep now.""  Guess he thought knocking me out was simpler than reassuring me it was nothing.

I awoke in a 'recovery area' that resembled a tiny broom closet, with 3 nurses hovering around. The nurses were not pleasant & were trying to hurry me out, while also threatening that if I couldn't pee (cause ya know, I've had so much to drink in the last 12 hours), that they would Foley cath me. They finally let me go when an ultrasound showed I had nothing *to* pee. 

They sent me home with very few instructions. I had to Google basically all my own aftercare info, including when I was allowed to resume alcohol & other medications. I got a text message from Walgreens saying my prescription was ready - what prescription? Nobody said s*** to me about a prescription. Oh, it's Cipro..... which I can't take. They should have discussed all of that before knocking me out. Didn't send anything for pain though, so thanks for that.

The whole experience left me extremely upset. I cannot stand being talked down to, being dismissed, or treated like my time isn't valuable. I don't cry hardly ever... but I have cried a few times today out of stress over all this. There was ZERO reason for a 20 minute procedure to turn into a 3.5 hour long ordeal. 

Get your Sugar Honey Iced Tea together, guys, and get some more compassionate staff while you're at it."
"Stephane Huve.  Grosse dÃƒÂ©ception,  les 3 plats que l'on a mangÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©taient dÃƒÂ©licieux mais ils n'avaient que la moitiÃƒÂ© des plats du menu, mÃƒÂªme pas d'oeufs pour une tortilla, et bien sÃƒÂ»r c'ÃƒÂ©tait toujours 10 minutes aprÃƒÂ¨s la commande que le serveur revenait nous dire la mauvaise nouvelle.

"Reviews and seeing it made me want to check it out. I would say the burger had a good taste and got a lot for the cost. I would eat there again but not get the burger, tons better burgers in town from other small places."
"My fiancÃƒÂ© and I and currently living down the street from Joe's! We drove past this place multiple times, we noticed this place being packed inside and the parking lot. We thought we should give it a try since it looked so popular.

We ordered the mango shaved ice and cherry flavor with soft serve ice cream. The overall taste wasn't bad, but it didn't have much flavor and other places I've tried. 

I wouldn't be against going back and having a treat, but It wouldn't be on the top of my list."
"After my son's first year of college we needed to store his items and Storage West is one of the more popular storage facilities in Vegas. This particular storage facility gives UNLV students a discount and when you shop around Vegas you can find much cheaper storages but please keep in mind that they do not have A/C, do not offer insurance, and well it is Vegas it is hot there. If you value your items at all then you want a place that is clean with no bugs, secured, A/C unit and that is maintained. 
When I first contacted them they were extremely professional and gave me a great pricing for the 3.5 months that Timmy was home. I love the fact that the unit was on the first floor and even though we took the smallest unit there was still plenty of room which is great because this next summer we are going to need it. I love that when I was making my decision that they had maintained great communication. More important was that when I flew in just a month earlier to visit my son I was able to do the paperwork ahead of time to guarantee the storage unit and did not pay until the day we started to move my son. 
If you are looking for a great place to store your items and not worry about damage from the heat and an easy place to literally drive up and store your items, then this is the place for you and if you are an UNLV student from out of time I cannot recommend this place enough. Please ask for Larry and Annette Anderson, they are wonderful you will get a great service with a wonderful smile and you can depend on them always providing great communication and a solid quote. Just an FYI, they do also have storage boxes, tape, etc for sale and the locks are very nice and worth the money and if you are student at UNLV ask them about their special rates for REBELS. ;}"
"First time and had a blast here a few nights ago. Very unique and interesting way of making golf a bit more fun. The building is beautiful inside and out. Staff was very friendly and helpful, considering they've only been open a few weeks... Golfed for 2 hours, ordered food and drinks with our server, delivered right to our private bay! Fun and practical business concept, I'd love to go back and I'm sure this place will continue to grow in other parts of the valley."
"I would really recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants soup dumpling, green onion pancake, fried dumplings or soup noodles in financial district. I love the fact that I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get good Chinese dishes. We ordered the soup dumplings and for once there was actually soup in it! It tasted so good! The fried pork dumplings were just as good, crispy on the outside and flavourful on the inside. We also ordered the pulled pork bao, that's the one I don't think is worth it. It was good but not great. The green onion pancake was ah-mazing! I think it might be the best I ever had. We also ordered the pork belly soup noodle and that was really good! The pork belly was my favourite! Overall I would give this restaurant 4/5. The restaurant can get busy really quick so the service might be a little slow. But other than that it was well worth it and the price is great! Definitely coming back when I am craving Chinese food."
"Not bad of a place but nothing to special,  considering the fact a pint is 11$. May as well just go to McLean's down the street much better prices. Haven't checked out the cigar lounge yet but maybe I'll come back to check it out."
"I went there yesterday for their buck a shuck oyster deal. It was a busy Tuesday night, but that does not excuse the horrendous service I recieved. We ordered 12 oysters and our drinks first, then ordered food. It took 30 mins for out oysters to arrive, and the drinks were nowhere to be seen. The table that got sat 15 mins after us got their drinks before us. The food, however, was excellent no complaints there. So after a 35 ish mins wait, we got our food, oysters and drinks all at the same time, cramped into the tiny table we were sat at. The server was in her own world. Not attentive even the tiniest bit. She literally walked away when we asked her a question. She did not deserve a single penny in tips, but we tipped her anyway. Maybe she was having a bad night? Regardless... Next time, we will not be so generous if this appalling service continues"
"Had a great haircut from Angi yesterday. My last hairstylist I felt like I had hit a dead end after 8 years and needed to try something new. I have tried 2-3 others but never really liked the results. A friend recommended Angi and I couldn't be happier. I wasn't sure what I wanted and Angi was great at suggesting something less drastic than I imagined to the relief of my husband who likes my hair long. 

Watching Vinny in action helping his clients you could tell he really cares when he was suggesting iPhone apps that could make life easier in addition to some beautiful short haircuts.

I also love that you can book online and get reminders for your appointments.

JJ also does amazing gels that last forever and her artwork is gorgeous."
"I don't get this place at all, it was Thursday night 9pm and almost completely dead inside except for our team party to celebrate the end of our conference.  The place is really nice, it's definitely more of a sports bar or a private party lounge for the boys.  We had the Jay Z suite, which opened out into a patio right on the strip.  Ridiculously nice location and amenities, but seriously where was everyone. 

I couldn't help noticing that all the waitresses were small Asian girls.  What's up with that, what are you trying to tell us Jay Z?"
Great tasting cakes every creative. Wonderful service. Excellent communication when calling or sending emails
"all problems were small to negligible until i got an emailed bill the day after returning the car for a 99$ off-road/car cleaning bill.
talked to a very rude woman on the phone who told me she had specifically told me that we weren't to take the car off pavement - she did not! i knew we would be going to state and national parks where the parking lots are NOT paved. i didn't realise i'd be penalized for that! when i tried to explain, she got ruder and ruder and then hung up on me. had i known, i'd have taken the damn car through a 5$ car wash. 
don't EVER rent from these rude people. stick to a reputable company!"
This past Saturday we ordered a take out 14 inch. The taste was decent. The toppings were a little skimpy. At this point I would have tried it again.  Then I realized I was chewing a hair
"First of all I love Cinnabon!! With that being said, the one in the Southpark mall is the worst I've ever been to. I brought a classic cinnabon, 10 cinna sweets and a lemonade. My cinna sweets were hard and they gave me water instead of lemonade. Ugh!!"
"This McDonald's is a very busy location.  The food tastes pretty much the same as any other McDonald's.  They do, however, need to work on the quality of their breakfast all day food.  I recently tried to have breakfast for lunch and will never make that mistake again. My egg McMuffin was burned and the egg was rubbery.  It looked like something that was left over from breakfast that they tried to reheat.  

The inside of the restaurant is usually very clean with seating options varying from booths, to tables with chairs, to high tables with stools.  There isn't a play area at this location. There's usually a wait to order and to get your food. The parking lot is very small and hard to get in and out of with the way the drive thru line blocks cars that are parked.  My car was hit by a hit and run driver while I was inside just to buy a drink.  Very expensive drink!!"
"Well I thought everything was fine until I realized they screwed me over. I went in at lunch, ordered wings and fries and then after I was finished found out there was a wing special that was cheaper and included a salad. The bartender ""forgot"" to tell me. The card she then handed me with the special was so old and torn up. This is not a new special. Make sure you ask. Otherwise they are just trying to run up your ticket."
"Once a great hotel... Now just an average hotel with big rooms!

I have been coming to the Rio for over 20 years. I was here when the masquerade tower just opened and had the hottest night club in Vegas. They had the best buffet back then too...

I know there are always newer and greater casinos that will come and go but Harrahs needs to understand that you can't cut back on everything and expect tons of people to still show up!

For those of you that don't know, the Rio had an amazing FREE show- Carnival in the Sky that was totally discontinued about a year ago! People loved it and came here just to see it. Then after, they would do some gambling, eat food and spend money in the shops. Now that area is totally dead! I spoke to many of the employees and they are unhappy about it too and saw a major drop in business!

Another disappointment was at the iBar. They got rid of the dancers that came on stage every so often. It made the place cool and hip to hang out and buy drinks!  Now it's just a regular bar with expensive drinks and I probably won't be spending my money there anymore. 

Now for the good... Rooms are large with lots of room for 5 or more people if u need it.  You get a lot more room for your money compared to the strip. This is the main reason I still come here but not sure after all the cutbacks. However they do charge a resort fee and will charge you for an early check in! I was charged $10 to check in 2 1/2 hrs early. 

Buffet is still good but very pricy now at around $33/person for dinner on a weekend.  Hash House had the best breakfast and lunch. They hit a homerun with this place!!! See my review for more info on that. 

Pool is decent for families with kids. But not great for the young party crowd. I believe there are 4-5 pools all together but one is a 21 and older only. 

Casino has lots of table games that have lower limits than what you can typically find at the high end casinos on the strip. There is also no shortage of slot machines either. 

If you want to experience the Las Vegas Strip, this is NOT the place for you! But if you want a big room and a big casino, then this may be for you!"
"I traveled yesterday morning for a 7:04 a.m. flight. I entered into the security check point in plenty of time and selected the shortest line. The lines on each side seemed to flow seamlessly while my line moved at a snails pace. Just my luck. :) But that isn't my biggest concern. 

When it was my turn to scan personal items I put my shoes, belt, and jacket into one bin and rolled it toward the TSA agent who assisted it onto a conveyor belt. As I waited in line to get scanned I watched the TSA agent speak to the woman who was behind me. She had put her jacket, shoes, and personal items on top of her laptop. Instead of asking her to go get a second bin he took her personal items and put them in my bin on top of my belongings. 

At first I was just upset that her shoes were on top of my jacket but in hindsight its more alarming than being respectful of travelers personal items. It's not that I think the woman behind me is bad person but what if the she had a weapon, drugs or paraphernalia in her jacket? Would I have been held liable since her items were in my bin? Would the TSA agent of accepted his wrongdoing if it escalated into questioning or conflict?

I'm not impressed with this lack of professionalism and violation of protocol. This TSA agent had no issue questioning travelers and calling them out when they weren't following rules but who is holding him accountable for taking short-cuts?"
"I've been to this place twice to have tires put on. The first experience was fine. Nothing noteworthy. Counter guy was friendly. The second time was a different story. Counter guy was still friendly, but after having my second pair of tires put on I started to get a lot of low and flat tires. Sometimes just get a little low, sometimes rim on the ground flat. This went on irregularly over a couple months. Checked the tires several times for punctures or anything. Nothing. Fast forward: road trip and stranded in Colorado. Took it to a tire shop and low and behold, the tires weren't cleaned around the seem before mounting so I got erratic leaks out the seem. One tire ended up being trashed. Sidewall started to split from being flat so many times. I go out of my way to patron privately owned shops. But I can't do that if things are done poorly."
"Three issues with this company: (1) when I looked them up doing research in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's on-line database, they've had their operating license involuntarily revoked...twice; (2) when I Google searched them, I found they're a defendant in a case in federal court wherein a pedestrian was injured and they did nothing about it for years; and, (3) I also found a public utility case about what sounds like the same accident, only it suggests that the company didn't even investigate or respond to the pedestrian's claims, and the jury is still out about whether, and how long, they'll be allowed to continue operating this time.  Pretty damning stuff."
"We had a party there for my daughter's birthday. The pizza was undercooked and doughy. We sent it back to be recooked. It wasn't any better. The pasta was bland and not worth the money. I had booked the party through the catering manager.  The manager never came over to see how the refired food was or how our party was going. I have been in the restaurant business for over 25 years. As a manager I always touched every table to make sure things were good and made a point of checking back several times on tables that had problems. The manager never checked to see how things were nor did the catering manager check back to see how things were. I guess spending $200 at a pizza place doesn't rate a call or followup. I will never go back. We tried to fix the pizza at home and we couldn't get the dough cooked. The server was great and tried to flux the problem, but the management, kitchen and catering staff failed. I will never recommend metro pizza and have told my friends who are also in the business about my experience and they won't go either. I like little small places but not this one. Way over priced  and the food was horrible. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! We should have gone to Rosati's, its much better."
The closest one in the west valley to is.  This place is fun and clean.  The staff are all super friendly and nice.  Not too super pack or crowded either. The kids love it here.
"I love that I found my go-to scottsdale spa!  Racheal does my hair (cut and highlights) and she is amazing, I wouldn't go anywhere or to anyone else.  I love that they have a ton of amenities (including a small pool!) so everytime I go, I can spend as much time as I want there.  They offer small snacks and tea/water and the staff is just so friendly and inviting.  Definitely would recommend Spa Lamar to anyone looking for a relaxing, enjoyable  spa day. Two thumbs up!!"
Love love love this park. I just recently moved into a house just up Gomer with my boyfriend & it is so convenient to take our little girl to have some fun! I love that there is so much to do for her & a nice grass area around back. Also made me feel safe to see security walking around! So glad to be living over here!
I came over the weekend and met Mandy who showed me and my friend around. Goodness the energy was amazing and i cannot lie these apartments are BEAUTIFUL! I read some good reviews & some not so good reviews. To be honest i was ready to give them all of my money Saturday. My mind was made up and this had been only the second placed i looked at. To be honest I'm so ready to leave the place I'm at now and just stay here. The only thing that's holding me back is their pet policy. Me and my girlfriend LOVEEE the place but we can't give up our baby ( we have a large dog ) our Lexi has been around for my girlfriend since before i came along and she's attached. She's just a puppy but she's way more than 20 lbs. it's so stressful looking for places. This is such an awful decision i have to make!!! Idk if i can allow my girl to give up Lexi. She means so much to us. This hurts! I guess I'm still on the hunt.
"Local company that sells nice furniture at an affordable price when on sale. The staff is friendly, helpful and patient. Charlotte was the person helping us and she did the job :) 

Update when our sofa and table will arrive in 1-2 weeks!"
"It is so nice in the hustle and bustle of Vegas to be able to walk up to a counter, pay a relatively inexpensive price (for Vegas standards) for some grub and receive the food within five minutes.  On top of that, these crepes are delish!    

What my hubby and I have done is order one salty and one sweet crepe and split them.  I believe they refer to them as meal or dessert crepes...just get one of each.  They are huge but you need to try more than one of these fairly inventive recipes.  I have not made it here on my last two trips to Vegas but Yelp just reminded me to go back and grub."
Excellent service and great location. Food is also very good and fresh. Will be a great place to watch football and hockey this fall. Bartenders are also very friendly and helpful.
"Aggressive prices, very nice support from Lee, John, Tammy and Joy -- BUT overall a bit disappointing.    I recommended them to our CEO and Sr. mgmt.  Collectively we were faced with Late pick-ups,  forgotten airport pick-ups, wrong vehicles for a long trip from Sky Harbor to Desert Ridge, cars with one head light out, no GPS...   Overall I've had better experiences with more reliable car services.  I would use them again but with caution."
"It is not often that I give a 1 star rating, but my experience tonight at Papa Rocks is deserving. My family has been coming here off and on for years. We've always found the environment a little dingy, but the pizza was good. I ordered a pizza for my family tonight, and was shocked at what I witnessed! 

The cook, the hostess said his name was Chris, reached down with his bare hands, picked some of the topping off and popped it into his mouth. He than whipped his hands on his pants, and continued to cut our pizza. I know this was mine, as I watched them finish boxing it up and bring it to me. 

Needless to say I was, and still am, furious! What makes it worse was that I waited for the GM for 10 minutes, and he never came out. At this point the  hostess told me he was on the phone, and wouldn't be able to come out. 

This has been the worst customer service that I have recieved in a very long time. It became painlessly obvious that they do not care about their customers dinning experience, or the health and well being of their customers.  I will never go back!"
Loved working with Jason and Scott. I was certified this past February and I don't think I'd be able to get through it without Jason. The certification was amazing and thorough - I felt comfortable and like a pro in my trip to Belize the following month. Thanks for everything guys!
"It is pricey for what you get. 

The quality of the food is just not there for the price you pay. For starters I chosen the surprise seafood, and receieved 3 breaded shrimp. For the main course the filet mignon was not cooked correctly (asked for med rare) lots of potato and broccoli. For dessert the sorbet, tasted like store bought tub of ice cream with canned fruit. 

The biggest upset was that we were seated before the couple beside us and they were served way before us and finished their dinner when we were still waiting for our main course. Even our drinks came after theirs.. 
It is obviously impossible to wave the waiter down to settle these issues and we were also forced to tip 20%."
"Ate here on a Tuesday night with my fiancÃƒÂ©. We started with the Brussel sprouts and charred carrots. Both were very satisfying. 

For our main courses I ordered the burger medium rare and my fiancÃƒÂ© ordered a forbidden rice curry dish. These were both ok, but not amazing. My burger came out well done but it wasn't dry and it still had a lot of flavor. 

If we go back, we will likely order more small plates of vegetables, which all sounded amazing, and likely stay away from the large plates."
This course was in good condition but looks like many of the other courses in the area.  Seems they need the money non members bring in but they also don't really want non members to play here.  Has nice lakes everywhere with swans and ducks.
"Aunties & Uncles ? What the hell is this place?

It should really be called: ""An awkward family meal at my 2nd cousins and the guy she's been seeing off/on for 3 years"". Because that's what it felt like.

Word of the Review: Awkward 

We decided to not go at a peak time as we knew there was often a line up...  so we showed up after the brunch rush to get a quick helping of food / caffeine. 

There was a SMALL line, but the turnover was just embarrassingly slow... people waiting at their tables cash in hand for a server - with the folks eagerly waiting  by the door to sit down - it was like the music shut off during musical chairs and we're just idling until the play button gets hit. 

New Word of the Review: Waiting 

So we waited and waited until a few tables got clear and the server starts seating the single customers at tables of 4 so that larger parties have to wait even longer to eat - I get that it's a first come first serve basis, but if they developed a system where the single diners eat together, they wouldn't be so spread out. Also the servers seemed aggravated as they passed by the doorway through the line up of customers - If folks are in the way, ask them to wait outside, or put our names on the list don't scoff at the business WAITING to eat at your establishment... in fact just acknowledge us as a people at the door rather than barreling by with one glass of water in hand. 

New New Word of the Review: System 

Our server seemed a little too cool for school with his dead pan customer service technique - I get it, you aren't the most chipper about serving brunch at A/U's after a long night of drinking sidecars at Montauk, but a smile and friendly greeting would have been nice - even if you faked it. 

New New New word of the Review: Put up or Montauk

Food took an average amount of time despite sitting right next to the kitchen - literally sitting beside it as the kitchen is right out in the open. But with the place holding 6/7 tables with a limited menu, I was hoping it would be out a little sooner. 

Food was middle of the road brunch food - as was the price, and although I was satisfied with the meal... I found the whole experience uncomfortable. The chairs, the heat from the kitchen, the overuse of garlic in all their food.... the whole place didn't jive with me despite it's home style kitchen atmosphere.

I'd probably pick a handful of other places over A/U's, and would only go there if there was no line - nothing else open -  AND IF IT WAS THE LAST RESTAURANT EVER, AND THE MONKEYS WERE PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE WERE ENSLAVED BY THE MONKEYS AND DIDN'T TALK, BUT THEN THE ONE FROM SPACE COULD TALK AND I BET THE MONKEYS DIDN'T LIKE THE TALKING PERSON SO THEY CAPTURED HIM BUT NOT ALL THE MONKEYS HATED HIM BECAUSE ONE OF THEM DIDN'T AND HELPED HIM ESCAPE BUT WHEN THEY ESCAPED THE OTHER MONKEYS FOUND OUT AND THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT.

New New New New word of the Review: Montauk the Planet of the Apes."
"This was my longest resting place for my road trip to Az. I stayed in mostly Super 8's while I was on my road trip because they were all pretty decent. This one disappointed me just a little compared to some of those that were right off of the interstate.

The gentelman that was at the counter when I arrived wasn't very pleasnt. He just seemed like he did not want to be there that day. When he told me where the room was, he pointed one direction, but it was actually in the opposite. 

Got to the room, it was clean had a lingering smell of smoke, and we were on the non-smoking side of the hotel. Overall the room was ok, up to date tv, lighting and floors.  Wasn't planning on spending much time in there, so that didn't really matter.

Overall it wasn't the best Super 8. It was ok for the time frame I was there which was 2 nights."
"Moi je fais partie de celle qui n'aime pas Como, . Mon argument principale est ...trop...Trop gras, trop de sel, trop de fromage, trop cher, trop de bruit, le service trop mauvais, mauvais langage, mauvaise humeur gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©raliÃƒÂ©... je suis aller souvent et j'y vais encore seulement quand j'ai pas le choix. Le stationnement est toujours plein? Il y a une raison?"
"This was a fairly standard Chipotle. You pretty much know what you are going to get regardless of which one you go into aside from one thing...how is the staff/service in any given location. So I'm going to mainly talk about that. I was there around 8pm so after the dinner rush however, myself and several others had to wait about 5 minutes while everyone ran around and restocked. I don't know if this was poor planning or just circumstances but several individuals were verbally agrivated. It wasn't ideal and slightly annoying. Not to mention they only had 1 person making the orders from start to finish and then a cashier. The other workers continued to cook/stock while there was a line forming back to the door. The worker making orders was trying to joke with people but it wasn't going over well. For example, the guy behind me asked for a chicken burrito and was told, ""We don't make those. We make quesadillas here."" He was not pleased with the joking especially since he had been waiting for almost 10 minutes by this point. A for effort but probably not the time for jokes.  At least the food I got was fresh. I can't knock them there. They store itself also appeared to be clean and in good condition. 

Like I said, maybe there were some call offs or they had just gotten through a major rush but it looked to me that there was a lot of goofing around going on and they got caught with their pants around their ankles.  I'd give this location another chance but if I have to wait again I'll find another Location to get my Chipotle fix."
"Just like everyone else says. This place has some of the best tasting burgers and fries. Although the choices aren't vast like the other burger places, whatever you get will be delicious, and inexpensive. I haven't yet tried the secret menu items, but definitely will the next time. I had the cheeseburger and fries combo, which cost about 6 bucks, and it filled me up. Really fast service too. Wish they opened in Hawaii!"
"I came here on opening day hoping to take a picture with that chicken character, but he was nowhere to be found. I'd never tried this popular Latin chicken chain despite living near several locations in the past, so we lined up to order food. It was about a 30 minute wait within the first hour of opening. 

For dining in, our food was delivered to our table moments later on real plates with silverware, and we were already sipping on a sweet guava agua fresca poured by the cashier. The street corn salad is more interesting than most fast food side dishes, with grilled corn, queso fresco, cherry tomatoes, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, and salad greens. It is not heavily dressed so I like to add a little chipotle honey mustard or creamy cilantro sauce. You won't find mac and cheese or mashed potatoes at this chicken place, but I can recommend the fried yuca, sweet plantains, and coleslaw. I'm not usually a coleslaw fan, but I saw a bowl on every other table and had to try it. It has crunchy cabbage and green bell pepper, no carrots. The veggies are finely chopped instead of shredded and swimming in creamy dressing-- not a light salad.

Oh, they also serve chicken. It smells better than El Pollo Loco but my critique ends there. I brought it home for my husband and he was craving more fried chicken by dinner time. At that point the line had extended to several hours, so he held off until Saturday evening and waited in the drive thru for over an hour. The horchata is somewhere between the very different Mexican and Salvadoran styles, but it is good. The ""Peruvian"" citrus marinated grilled chicken appears to have a lot of seasoning, but he says the fried chicken is much better. On both visits, we requested legs and thighs and found white meat mixed in with the order. It's understandable for such a busy grand opening with lines longer than conservative choice Chik-fil-a. Try all the sauces!

Love this place everything is fresh and delicious ! areas are clean and everything is well made unlike other places very messy and uncomfortable environment. Love the seviche chips
"They never informed me of the extra 30 dollars in ""fees"" until they charged my card. Was on hold for a half hour for a manager and ended up going straight to a voicemail box. No return call so I'm basically screwed. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE."
"I live in Mt. Washington and I love my neighborhood.  This is probably the best place for a night out on Mt. Wash, in my opinion.  The restaurants on Grandview are overpriced, outdated, and the food isn't that good in my opinion (yes, I'm looking at you, Monterey Bay, LeMont, Tin Angel, et al.).  I visited La Tavola for the third time since I've lived up on the Mount (where I've been for 3.5 years) on Friday, January 17.  

I'll go over the positives - of which I find many - first.  First, my main course, the veal Polina, was done very well.  The veal is sliced thin and cooked (not breaded) with eggplant and proscuitto over it, and then covered with melted provolone.  I thought this was tasty and seasoned well.  It was not overcooked.  The veal was a little oily, but not so much to find it annoying.  Overall a great dish.

I went with a large party and we all brought bottles of wine.  The staff was great about opening the wine in a timely fashion, and chilling the bottles of white at the table.  The corkage fee isn't bad.  The table ordered several appetizers for the group to share.  We had beans and greans with sausage, beans and greens without sausage, fried calamari, and something else I can't immediately recall.  I found these all very good and done very well.  The calamari was not over fried, and it wasn't overbatted (I hate seeing that at restaurants).  

Another positive was that they offer gluten-free (rice) pasta.  My friend who had the gluten-free pasta thought it was done well and not overcooked.

Some of the negatives were things that I didn't experience personally.  A few friends complained that their meals were cold (not warm at all).  I thought the service was kind of slow.  It took a long time to get our meals generally.  However, the server was pleasant.  

They don't split more than 4 cards for a large party, but I learned this ahead of time when I  made reservations and we were encouraged to bring cash.  That worked out pretty well.

BYOB is one of my favorite features here.  The dishes themselves aren't terribly pricey, but if you get the whole nine yards - appetizers, entrees, coffee, etc. - you will be likely to shell out around $40 a person.

Overall, I thought it was a decent dining experience.  My food was good.  I think some of the negatives are service-related.  I would go back, though, and likely will."
"I really liked how they had various gourmet plates in a buffet setting, you know, things that you won't normally order at a fancy restaurant, i.e. watermelon with Sriracha and lime drizzle. The selection for salad and meat were substantial and they had a mountain of king crab legs for the customers. Prime rib was good, sushi was ""meh""... my favorites included the sausage, roasted pork belly, and OMG the huge dessert bar. 

Overall, I wasn't impressed by the buffet and they didn't have much of a seafood selection. Food quality was definitely better than typical local buffet, but just ""OK"" for Vegas."
"Not cheap but decent value.   

Large, well-done, interior.  Very good staff. 

Great beer selection, of course.  Just had an amazing IPA (Medusa), house-brewed, only 5%, citrusy and hoppy, just perfect. 

I can only vouch for the burger and fries, which were fine.  

If, like me, you don't like the Danforth's restaurants much, this could be your go-to."
"My family and I came to GC today around 3:30 pm (03/21/17). We were not caught in the stereotypical dinner traffic, but it had enough traffic.

Golden Corral is a smorgasbord of food. You have assorted salad makings, meats, potatoes, and desserts.

Nika was our waitress and she is a gem.

I saw some people complaining about overcooked food, but what do you expect when you put food under heat lamps?

Overall, I was pleased with today's visit and will be back again.

Review #201."
"First word that comes to mind is WOW! 
If you're visiting Las Vegas leave the black jack table (most likely you're not going to win and if you do you'll give it back) and leave the cirque du soleil shows behind!!! 

We all know Jennifer Lopez does it all but man I couldn't believe how entertaining this show was!!! She sang songs from her old goodie Jams to her current including a couple special ones! She interacted with the audience, danced her show away and hit every note and move. At 46 she's never looked better. Her outfits were just as amazing! I was surprised with tickets for my birthday and I couldn't have imagined a better gift/night. I'm glad she's at this venue too because unlike other properties getting in and out of parking is never a hassle at Planet Hollywood. 

Btw, I wish they had a JLO store instead of the Britney Spears store still because the little booths for merchandise were too long after the show. Maybe a couple more booths would be beneficial!"
"Of the vegeterian places I've tried in Montreal, this is one is definitely one of the ones on the top of my list - I'm especially in love with the hemp burger!

Sadly, that also means I have not wanted to order anything else yet :/"
"Decided to try out the new restaurant in the neighborhood as we would really like to find a good place close to home. The only good thing I can say about this place is the service was friendly and the food came out quickly. That's where the good ends. The food was horrible? I ordered the gumbo, which generally has shrimp and uses veggies like celery! Bell peppers and onions. Theirs has none of this, instead what I got was a brown goo with what appeared to be canned chicken and beef. I also ordered the boudin balls, again not good. The outside was nice and crisp, but the inside was nothing but rice and raw breading ""paste"". Where was the boudin? My husband had the andouille sausage, he said it was ok, but it was literally a sausage with mustard on what looked like an uncooked bun (it was white!). Our friends had the oyster po boy and the shrimp ÃƒÂ©touffÃƒÂ©e. I had a bite of he po boy and thought it was awful...maybe I just don't like oysters, but my friend said it was just so so. The shrimp ÃƒÂ©touffÃƒÂ©e got an ok review by my other friend, however it he menu said it came with rice...you had to look really hard for the rice under what looked like the same brown goo they called gumbo. One of the sides that was ordered was the Mac and cheese...it had no cheese flavor, needed salt and all the macaroni noodles were broken up and scooped into a glob.

The extended bar is nice and they could really turn that place into a great neighborhood bar, the food just needs some major tweaking. We were there on a Saturday night and they had karaoke which is always fun, however the ladies that were running it brought their young kids and had them singing too...weird and not the place for kids.

I dont think we will be back and sadly if the food doesn't drastically improve, I give this place 3 months before it meets the same fate as the other restaurants that have been in the same location. They need to decide if they want to be a Cajun place or a BBQ and burger place....I say drop the Cajun food and stick with burgers."
"Walked into Distill and thought we'd walked into Eden. This is my first and last visit. Decent prices during football hrs so we were planning on being there at least 3 hrs. Until about maybe 30 mins into it when I was asked to move from a unique (1 of 2) machine at the bar so a woman (who had just won and cashed out a decent amount, I can assume at the other,) wanted to play where I was sitting. Not one for playing a a machine while my hands are dirty, due to the appetizer sampler that had arrive 5 mins prior, I was waiting to play until finished. Though my boyfriend next to me was playing his machine, and having already been asked if we were playing, I was asked to move to a different seat. Thoroughly upset I was too polite to say no and speak my mind. 

Felt it appropriate to add as well the women's restroom was in poor order. One of the two stalls was not only out of paper but had toilet seat covers covering the floor of the stalls. As accidents and people happen, I would have not paid attention to this if weren't for the fact I could hear myself even speak out loud due to the loud music. I don't often mind this being in my mid 20's but really?

As good as the food was (reason for the 2nd star), and as regular as we would have become living and working just down the road, we won't be returning. Which is saddening since Molly's closed and the food was good. 

Don't expect to stay in the seats you may choose or get common courtesy in this establishment unless it's from Brianna."
"I have used this company for a few of my properties and when I started about 5 years ago I didn't have many issues.  It was convent to use the same company for my newer purchases for my rentals and man this is by far the worst experience I have had.  Multiple properties have had issues and my last issue was a washer that had gone out and they told me they would replace it,  it has now been over a month and my renter is fed up with hand washing.  If you call in for a claim or just to even talk to someone expect to wait 45minutes or MORE! Try doing that a few times to fix an just 1 issue.  I will now look for another company to do business with. Thanks for nothing but a $75 service fee and more money and time out of my pocket."
"im not a buffet person but there was defintely a great selection from ribs, seafood, sushi to a wide variety of desserts. 

the buffet was pretty pricey around 26.99 on weekends."
Chilaquiles is on point. I bought them last and saved them for breakfast today. The sauce and tortillas were SO good!
"My quest to find passport photos at a Shoppers Drug Mart came to its merciful end here. The photo section was actually manned (or, in this case, womaned), and I was able to get my picture taken quickly--they had a little screen that pulled down by one of the refrigerator cases. After a five-minute wait poking throught the Wii games and battery rechargers, I was on my way with some photos for a mere $10.

As for the rest of it, this Shoppers was about the same as the others. There's some tacky Halloween stuff out now, like mugs with fake rat tails sticking out of them which spin when you pick them up."
"Best Mediterranean food everrrrrrrrrr! Their hummus is simply amazing, they have 40+ variety in vegetarian food which is very hard to come by. We tried farmers market pitza and falafel appetizers it was lip smacking."
"Absolutely awful. Don't get your car washed here. Too much money for the result. I had to re-clean my car after they cleaned. Three different teams wiped my car down and still missed major spots. Not to mention, they were using dirty rags. They will NOT be getting my business anytime soon."
"I went to the Bonefish Grill in Maryland and my experience was okay because the service was excellent, considering how busy it was.  The food was not that hot though, the scalloped potatoes were cold and undercooked. My fillet mignon was really good and lean though, crab cake was really tasty though not hot too.  

Finding out they had recently opened a location in the Pittsburgh area was exciting.  I thought I could give this a place a try on a more quiet night, hoping that they could pay better attention to the food. It was incredibly packed on a Wednesday night; the wait was an hour.  
We ordered the 2 for $39.9. The meal came with 3 very small cuts of ahi tuna, salmon, sea bass, as well as 2 shrimp and 2 scallops. It also included 2 salads and 2 sides (asparagus $1 extra and garlic mash potatoes) on another plate with their signature garbanzo salad.  The fish was just simply undercooked.  The ahi tuna made my stomach turn, because it was raw, and I understand that is how they do it.  It just did not sit well with me.  The texture of it was just too mushy and flavorless.  My taste buds were not very excited to work the sea bass either- salmon, I make that at home and it wasn't good either.  The scallop I ate was undercooked too. 

In the end, our bill with tip came to about $60 (we got water). I'm not sure I'll ever pay that price again to wait an hour for food that is disappointing to just okay.  I might stop by for Happy Hour because the service is really good and the atmosphere is extremely nice (slightly crammed).  However, dinner would be more enjoyable, for me, somewhere cheaper and better tasting.  The 4 of us that went left agreeing that TGI Fridays would have been better and much cheaper."
This is the first hiking place I've been to. Visited twice the first time we couldn't go past the first mountain because my boyfriend is afraid of heights. But I went back with some friends and it was a good time. It's a bunch of small to medium mountains you can go around or go over as many as you want and then go back. It's like a roller coaster of mountains. I like it it's a good Saturday morning workout instead of hitting the gym. They have a restroom and water fountains (never used) but it's a good visit for first time hikers or just a way to get your blood flowing. I haven't been to other mountains yet so I can't say if this is the best or worst but I enjoy going.
"Good food. Slow service at this particular location, at least the day I visited. They were out of a lot of things, including silverware, napkins, and ice, which seemed strange with less than five customers inside. However, the spicy mango plate was on-point though."
The layout and idea is dope! I'm not a fan of the house music that they play personally. If the weather is bad it's pretty much no point in going at all. I have a good time when I go mostly. Lots of pretty girls
"I liked this place better than Wet Republic. 

As usual, we didn't have a problem getting in after putting our names on the list the night before.

The decor is pretty and even on a Monday, the crowd was better than Wet Republic on Sunday.  However, much to my surprise, the crowd was still pretty icy.  Guess no one wants to chat until the sun comes down?

Drink prices were outrageous.  We just didn't bother besides water, but I really like the decor and layout of this place.  I really love looking up and seeing Encore on one side and the Wynn on the other!"
"I absolutely love this place.  Fast friendly service all around!  My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and after ordering, got into a lovely conversation with the sushi chef.  The ingredients were wonderful and extremely fresh, even for our late 9pm dinner.  I never had to ask for drink refills!  The family at the hibachi behind us seemed very happy and their chef had the kids giggling!

The restrooms were clean and neat.  The place itself was perfectly decorated.  Tastes food and great conversation.  I could not have asked for more!

Yes I'll come back here for sure!"
"I must admit, I almost didn't come here since Bravo only had 3.5 stars on Yelp. But, when I went to make reservations on OpenTable, I noticed it was 4.4 stars, so I figured why not? I'm so glad I did!!

I started out with the strawberry mojito. It was wonderful. Freshly muddled lime and all!

They bring out bread with what I assume was red pepper infused olive oil/spices. It was really yummy (I ate it all, naturally). 

As an appetizer, I ordered the lobster bisque. It was good, but nothing special. It was thicker than I'm used to (not necessarily a bad thing) and it did have big chunks of real lobster in it, so that was nice. 

I ordered the Woozie as my entree (basically fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and spinach). The pasta was PERFECTLY al dente. Couldn't have been cooked any better! The Alfredo sauce was also delicious and I ate every bite (and lapped up the rest with my leftover bread). 

Creme brÃƒÂ»lÃƒÂ©e is my weakness. Whenever I see it on the menu, I have to order it. I was almost upset to see it on the menu here because I was so full, but I ordered it anyways. And I'm glad I did. It definitely places in the top 5 I've ever had (excluding the times I've been to Italy, of course). It's small and manageable, so I definitely recommend it even if you're full! 

I arrived at 7:45 and had all my food/drink by 8. So, they definitely get you in quickly. I sat in their outdoor area which was nice. I was sort of nervous about eating at a chain, but it didn't let me down. I love Italian food and I was blown away by Bravo!!"
"For a chain of ""fast food"" American-Mexican food, it's delicious! Cheap prices, convenient location, and quick service. I appreciate the salsa bar offering red and green salsas, pickled jalapeÃƒÂ±os, carrots, and onions, cucumbers, and radishes. The salsas could be better, but I like the flavor of the red salsa adds a nice spice to the food. Service isn't necessarily friendly, but for a two-minute interaction, I don't really care. You order your food at the cashier, you pay, you pick up your food, then you eat. That's it.

This location has only a picture menu with no prices (except the breakfast options). A lot of their items are drenched in (not-so-melted) shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or guacamole, so you've been warned. I simply order my meal without one or all of these toppings and I'm satisfied.

I've only been here a handful of times, but the experience has been consistent. I normally order Carne Asada Fries or Nachos and/or Carne Asada Tacos. I don't normally deviate from these items, but I have had the Breakfast Burrito and Tamales. Everything has been tasty. 

During my visit yesterday, I wanted to see how their Pastor stood up to street vendors, so I ordered two Al Pastor Tacos ($2.30/each) topped with pico de gallo and guacamole. Not too shabby! I was surprised that the pork was so tender and flavorful. Certainly a good alternative to street tacos! Ruben ordered the Chicken Quesadilla Combination Plate ($6.35) that was packed with three very large slices of quesadilla, refried beans, and Mexican rice. The chicken was moist and juicy and there was so much of it! They're not holding back. We also shared Carne Asada Fries ($6.95), always delicious, although they never season their fries, so it just needs a bit of salt. A small drink with unlimited refills is just $1.50 (no lemon-lime soda option) and all prices include sales tax."
"I really liked going to this nail salon. The first couple times I had a good experience. Felt comfortable and I was acknowledged immediately. My pedicure was great. 

The last two times have been horrible though. The last time I went with a friend and we both got pedicures. It started chipping very quickly and my friends polish was everywhere. Didn't make much sense. Still, i went back. Like i said I enjoyed this place. This time the wait was outrageous (it was busy so understandable). But there were five people signed in after me getting called back to get pedicures. When i said something ..because I'm not invisible and that's how i felt..the lady was rude. All i wanted was for someone to say hello. Maybe tell me how long it would be. Then they let me sit in a pedicure chair with luke warm water for fifteen minutes before someone even came over to give me my pedicure. I will absolutely not be back. I'll spend my money somewhere else."
"Let's just say I will NEVER go to this or any other SUBWAY ever again. Basically, an employee of Subway harassed my boyfriend to where he felt like a hobo or just simply profiled. When I approached the man about it, he was aggressive and rude! My biggest complaint with him was with the insult he said as the disagreement was coming to an end ""you guys need to leave as you are harassing me. I need to get to REAL CUSTOMERS"". Mind you, I had bought food and was standing there with my combo in hand.
 There is a way to talk to customers who don't agree with you. At no point, were you to get caught up in a temper and throw that insult! 
To add to it, he is apparently the owner! He called me on the phone yesterday and argued with me for another 20-30 minutes. 
NEVER AGAIN will I go there and spend any of my company's money or my hard earned money for lunch/dinner. 
Customers beware! If you have a complaint, you can't do anything about it and Subway corp wont either!"
"I had a very good experience. A tech came out the same day I called, the day after Christmas and within the 2hr time frame specified. He gave me options for repair or replacement. The cost for replacement was very reasonable, even checking buying the door myself at Lowe's etc. They returned to replace the door on time and did the job efficiently. Both techs were polite and friendly. I would recommend and definitely use again."
"Horrible customer service. We waited over an hour when we were told 45 minutes and as I'm writing this, still waiting. The hostess ""assumed"" We wouldn't want to sit at the bar. Everyone else walked in and got a table within half an hour if not less.  The hostesses disregard of saying ""sorry"" is not excusable. When I come to Charlotte I always looked forward to coming here. Never again."
"We spotted this place as we drive through lakeshore village all the time. The sign alone drew me in, stating that they made homemade chocolates, ice cream and confectionary. SOLD!

We ended up here one hot summer night when my boyfriends parents and sister were visiting from Boston. We were all very happy with our ice cream choices. I tried the Bailey's Chocolate Truffle and it was absolutelly fantastic. We all loved what we tried and knew we'd be going back again.

The place is small, but they have a few tables inside to sit at. The staff were friendly, and gave my boyfriend a sample when he wasn't sure what he wanted to order. Will probably be our new go-to place for Ice Cream!"
"Some great clothes and great bags- but I agree that the employees could use some upgrading.  As soon as you walk in they seem unhappy you came.  Whatever!  Okay selection, terrible customer service."
I was really interested in these apartments until I visited the office. The woman barely took a look at me. I told her I was interested in learning more about the place. And she just handed me a list of the current prices and didn't take her eyes off the computer screen. I was hoping for a tour but instead I just sat there thinking of things to say so that we could continue the conversation but she kept trying to cut it short with me. So I was like f*ck this place. Never considering it again. First impressions and the way the leasing office treats you really make a difference. This woman could give a sh*t if a new lease gets signed or not. Living here is probably as ghetto as the b*tch working at the office. Rude.
"Ack. How could I have forgotten to write a review for this place? Having taken my Toyota SUV here numerous times, in my naivetÃƒÂ© after I first bought it, I soon came to loath the service department in particular. Having since had to purchase parts and deal with people on the phone, I have since realized the entire place is staffed by would-be brain donors. 

I don't even know where to begin, but I would be remiss without pointing out the absolute cluster@#$% that is the service department. Disorganized, appointments that never did mean jack shit, and to top it off, as many others have noted, the service writers are rude. Not just having a bad day rude either, but full on douche-bag rude. If you refuse the un-needed services they constantly push (I lost count how often they told me a perfectly aligned vehicle needed to be aligned, or how often my brand new air filter was badly in need of over-priced replacement), then they just get even snippier with you. 

To wit, when I ask them not to screw with things in my car, as has happened numerous times at their dealership, they have the balls to deliberately mess with everything I listed off. When I confronted the service writer, he launches into some tirade about how they have to adjust everything (seats, mirrors, steering, and apparently the radio?) in order to safely operate the vehicle for the 50 feet between the drive up and the bay where the mechanic works. Really? You're going to feed me that bullshit when nobody else in my two decades of having cars serviced has ever had to do this? It's not like I'm a midget or an NBA player, so most humans should be able to drive my car 50 feet into the bay without putting their lives at risk. But hey, God forbid you could just apologize, oh no, argue with the paying, repeat customer instead about how he clearly doesn't understand the tremendous burden and the operational risk involved to not screw with his mirrors or seats. Absolutely unmitigated pricks. 

Furthermore, with all this recall nonsense going on right now, I have been inundated with requests to bring my vehicle in for the airbag update. I try to call and schedule it, and get some yarn about how even though the mailers say it takes about an hour, no no, they need my SUV for several days. I can get a loaner, possibly, but they're not sure. Even then, it would be some shitty little death trap and not an SUV. I finally came to the decision that, given all my bad experiences with these clowns, I would sooner take my chances with shrapnel to the face from a defective airbag than let them get their grubby mitts on my vehicle again, certainly not for several days. They can't even put the seat back where they found it, so God only knows how badly they'd screw everything up if they have to rip the dash apart. 

And on that happy note, in case anyone from the dealership sees this review and opts to respond with their cookie cutter nonsense reply, let me be 100% clear: I would sooner take it up the ass than set foot in your dealership again, especially the service department."
Had a great meal here. I had the roast beef sandwich that had a good amount of horseradish which I like. My wife focaccia sandwich which she enjoyed. The only negative is that I wish they had a larger selection of beer on tap. They had 7 beers on tap but they did have a huge selection of bottle beers. We had the brownie dessert and the champagne peach sorbet which we enjoyed. We had great service also.
"Not sure how this place got such high remarks bc it was not good! ""Garlic fries"" didn't have any garlic flavor and you can tell the fries were previously frozen. I ordered the Kinoko burger, extremely salty. The shitaki mushrooms were good but the hamburger patty was thinner than what I would expect after spending over $10 and it was pretty over cooked. I would not come back here to eat."
"This place will rip you, (and your cute kid who insists on ordering her own dinner), off in a New York, (or in this case - Toronto), minute and not think twice about it.  For example, my daughter ordered a ""cheese quesadilla please""...whereupon she was asked, ""would you like a small or large?""...""large please""...""do you want meat?"", ""No thank you"", ""Beans, corn, tomatoes, salsa, onions""...""No thank you, just cheese please...""

Only at check out was Daddy informed that the $3 kids cheese quesadilla is only available in small and that the ""large"" that was offered to the cute and polite little girl is only available at full cost - slightly more than TWICE the price, despite the fact that it's only a slightly larger cheese quesadilla.

Had it not been late and with a hungry child, I'd have walked out...

Horrible customer service, I will never eat there again...even under duress."
"I am so put up with Best Buy. I have ordered 6 different TV within the last 2 months because of the TV was either cracked, didn't work with arc 1 input on our receiver,  or the orders continued to be pushed back.  I lost count on how many times I tried calling BB and got disconnected or the phone never was answered.  Mark helped us out a few times,  and he did a good job getting our situation fixed but the hassle of going to BB continually, especially during the holidays was not on my agenda.  We finally received the 70"" Vizio 4k TV and it's awesome.  Great TV. But next time,  I will go elsewhere!"
"2nd visit.   Time to try new stuff.   Thanks to checking in from Yelp, I was given a blue corn tamale.  It was very tasty,  but a little too moist.   Not like a traditional tamale.  

I got the blood orange margarita.   It's missed with jalapeno and that definitely gives it a little kick.   It's good,  but I won't get it again.

I got the skirt steak.   Cooked perfectly.   I would definitely get it again.   The Cress salad (carrots,  tortilla chips,  and red onion) was fantastic."
"Oakmont Bakery has the bright clean pre-fab character-free atmosphere of a retirement community cafeteria or a dental clinic, only it's also much like the DMV in that you take a number and wait around forever with a crowd of annoying half-crazed people. On my one and only visit, I waited for over a half hour on a summer day (at least it was corporate-cool in there) to buy a loaf of bread. I went in seeking a sandwich, but the options were boring and few. The loaf of bread I bought was not holy, but holey. And this holiday season, we received a platter of assorted Oakmont Bakery cookies which were disgusting, even according to my cookie monster of a boyfriend. 

I don't understand the ecstatic praise. Maybe it's because I don't believe in god or preservatives (which have lowered people's standards)."
"I would probably eat here more often if it didn't cost $20 a sandwich. Not only that but they try to tack on extra charges like $1.00 for lean meat even when you don't ask for it. 
It's unfortunate because their pastrami is killer. So buttery and delicious and they have really good mustard"
"If you are used to Japanese Sushi. This is not it. This is white person sushi. 

The restaurant its self is very nice. And the booths are very private which is cool. The tempura is delicious and shrimp tempura was huge. 

After that it goes downhill and fast. The sushi was ready way way to fast to be fresh. We were in at 5:30 and had food at 5:35... The presentation was non existent. Just rice and seaweed on a plate and the rolls were lacking rice and falling apart. 

The sashimi was grainy because of the way it was cut. The soy sauce is sweet... Like they used tempura sauce to make a bottle go further. 

Very unfortunate as it is so close to home and a really good price. But it goes to show you get what you pay for."
"Wow, it's definitely time that I update my previous review!

Here's why: I have actually been inside (quite a few times) and the employees are super friendly and helpful. However, that is not what gets me going back - they have an AMAZING selection of craft beers, including those from local breweries. 

I no longer live in the area, so I don't stop here as often as I used to - but if you are in the area, it's easy to access, right off the 215. Great place to fill up, get a car wash and take home some awesome beer. Check it out!"
I LOVE their salads!  The outside area is pretty nice.  Inside gets crowded.  Service has always been great.
"$50 dining credit from our hotel offer & we chose to spend it here for a quick lunch. My taste buds weren't working properly and my appetite was pretty much non-existent. It was already 2pm in the day and I knew I had to get some sort of grub. I also chose this spot because my good pal, Lilli S. frequents it and always recommends the lobster benedict. 

The lobster benedict was the only thing on my mind when it came to ordering. Not only because Lilli recommends it but because she has legit taste so it was a no brainer. Although, I didn't initially enjoy it much (refer to above paragraph), I did enjoy it later for a late night snack. They definitely do not hold back on the lobster. Since I'm a ketchup addict, I doused it with the good ol' Heinz 57 (Guch would disagree).

Across the way is Wynn's buffet, so if you don't feel like pigging out then Terrace Point Cafe is an available close option. The service was good and the atmosphere & setting is obviously classy. For some odd reason there were a lot of single-sitting women around me. Their counterparts were probably at a convention or blowing away the kid's college funds elsewhere.

In conclusion, a solid 3 star on my only entree' and my overall half-conscious experience here."
They only had one waitress running the entire floor.  Service and food was very slow and when the order came it was wrong. I don't think I will go back. It is probably for the better that the kitchen caught fire when it did and put this place out of it's misery.
I've been to other crepe stores in las vegas. But this crepe houe is extraordinary~ they only use fresh fruit everytime and the size is begger than anywhere else. It is almost Twice as big.
"Absolutely amazing food & even better service, thank you Vanessa for all of your excellent service, A++++!"
"This a typical hong kong style cafe. Food is average, nothing special, nothing bad, nothing spectacular.

However one thing they seem to do really good with is the drinks. The milk tea that they make are by far the best in the area. I will go here sometimes just to buy a drink."
"BEST coffee house (and currently it's an actual house) EVER! The staff - Mo, Angelica and everyone else are AWESOME they are great ppl. But the coffee, tea & other drinks are just too delicious - hot or iced. Try them all because you won't be disappointed."
"Just be aware that the place is real nice put be carful about the time they charge you for 1 hour put they only massage for 40 minutes.,
About the supposed professional massage my wife do better than that and she thinks the same way about it.,and make sure you tip them other ways they make sure they ask for it !!!
Real UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!
In another words is not worth it!!!!"
"On a trip to breweries on a sunny weekend day, my wife and I stopped at Salud Cerveceria first.  After searching for free parking, we gave up and parked in the $3/hr public right next to the Salud.  

We entered the door and walked up the flight of stairs to the brewery tap room.  Softly playing in the background was a good mix of punk and music from the old shoegazing era.   small stage area was setup for a live music, with a wood bench built against the wall with tables and benches lining it up.  It was a picture perfect facade of trendy hipster.  

We were not greeted, nor told anything about their beers.  When asked if they offer flights - the answer was no, but they offer smaller pours that fit the bill of a flight glass.....so we ordered 7 samples and brought them over to our table one-by-one.  When a brewery doesn't offer a flight, they lose points from me immediately from me.  We sat down, and looked around - for being afternoon, the crowd was confusing.  We were one of 5 people drinking beer...the rest looked like they belonged in a star bucks, not a brewery.  There were more Apples with Microsoft word open being typed vigorously by a group of tea and coffee drinkers...It was quiet, and the looks our kid got for playing was hilarious.  

The beer was mediocre, only one of the samples I had was good - the gose, the three IPAs I sampled were snooze worthy at best.  

Walking out and visiting other breweries that day was the best choice we made, and really put this visit in perspective.  If you want a fun day out sampling beers - go elsewhere.  If you want to sip coffee and feel like you're at a library - you found the place...."
"My first time in this barber shop and the last one! pay $ 22 for a haircut in which the right job was not done! the same knives and do not disinfect, there is no order to attend customers and friendships go first !!!! thanks guys"
Slow but fun....just don't expect to eat or drink fast .....
"I feel like it's always hit or miss. When it's good it's good but when it's bad it's bad. I come here once or twice a month. I enjoy the fries but they overload them with way to much salt, and tonight I can tell they haven't changed out the oil in awhile because the fries tastes like catfish. Next time I eat here I hope I can give a 5 star review."
"I really like this place. You can get excellent quality food in a fairly casual place. It's nice, but I wouldn't feel like I had to dress up to go there. The food is just how I like it.  Fairly simple dishes made with great quality ingredients.  I really like the fact that they offer grass fed beef, and they also have organic chicken, and some decent vegetarian options.  The Mac and cheese is one of my favorite sides. It has Anaheim peppers in it which make it a little different. Everyone should do themselves a favor, and get the apple pie for desert. 

It's a little pricey, but worth every penny.  That just means I can't go every week. They also have some of my favorite servers around. They are all really nice, and great at their jobs. I have nothing bad to say about anything here."
"I was at the Encore Beach Club over the weekend with a couple of my friends.
We were enjoying our time by the pool, when we noticed the crowd began to have some fun by splashing some water.
We met some nice people by the pool, one of them started to play with her man by splashing a little water on him and accidentally splashed some water on one of the lifeguards. the amount of water was minimum, close to nothing, but the lifeguard was not pleased by it. She rudely asked them to get out of the water. (DO REMEMBER we are at a pool, and the lifeguard should always expect to get wet. also, it's a pool. Am i suppose to just stand there and NOT touch the water?)
The lifeguard instantly got down from her post, and started to approach the woman aggressively asking her to step out of the water. The woman who was told to get out of the water agreed to leave with her friends, and as they were walking out we noticed the lifeguard lady rushing her! RUSHING HER! This lifeguard (I believe her name was Liliana Silva) ran towards her as if she was going to hit her! The woman was leaving with her party, she was cooperating with security so I was amazed that the Encore would allow their staff to act so rudely. The woman did throw a shoe in her at defense, which a lot of us agreed we would've done the exact same thing under those circumstances. If she would have not defended herself, the lifeguard would've really hurt this girl. She looked so young too!! This made me feel really unsafe about the security of Encore. They were so rude to the woman and her friends when they were clearly not doing anything bad! They did not defend their guest as much as they backed up their staff. We all clearly saw the lifeguard girl acting extremely rude and unprofessional, and they tried to hide it by putting the attention on the actual guest! MIND YOU, THE WOMAN WAS NOT DRUNK AT ALL! As I mentioned earlier, I had made friends with her and her party and took it upon me to make sure they were okay.... well that wasn't possible since the Encore actually kicked them out of the hotel in general!! I would not recommend coming here. It is a very popular hotel, but the security sucks and so does the staff! The lifeguard was extremely aggressive and seemed violent. The rest of my visit here I spent it being paranoid that the smallest complaint was going to be taken the wrong way. The hotel is all for their staff, but definitely not for the people."
Ate here today with the family.  We were sat promptly and had to wait a little for a server.  The manager noticed this quickly and got on it and resolved the issue before we had to ask.  Our server Steph was great and attended to us with professionalism.  We have not been to this Red Robin in years and plan to continue to come back when in the neighbor hood.  Overall impressed.  Had the BLTA croissant for the first time.  Could use a little more avocado but I enjoyed it.  I recommend this restaurant.
"Recently under new ownership (late 2014) but with the same top notch Pasquale led tailoring team, John has reinvigorated this Pittsburgh shop with a modern touch. After moving from New York City I was apprehensive about finding a tailor here in Pittsburgh but John quelled my fears. In fact, I went out of my way to drive from the Strip here to get work done. They also do custom clothes as well (although I haven't personally tried but I've been impressed by what I've seen.) Turnover time can sometimes take a little longer but it's worth it as they do top notch work. I'm moving back to Detroit soon so sad to leave but would not hesitate to recommend to any looking for a high quality tailor shop in Squirrel Hill or the Pittsburgh area."
I love this place!! Marianne is a sweetheart. Amazing and attentive. The food is always out super fast and tastes wonderful. The banana nut muffins are the greatest!!
"Fantastic upholstery job! These people are kind, friendly and very professional.  Understood what I needed to have done to my chair and benches and offered their own fabric when I didn't have enough for all three.  The pieces turned out beautiful.  I will definitely contact them again for future projects.  My husband's office chair is next on the list! Thank you."
"Helpful note for those visiting to watch ""O"", please book your tickets in advanced; its amazing how they are always sold out!  I love Cirque du Soleil performances because there's not only no animal cruelty, but they aim to impress you with their wonderful stunts and novelty.  This ""O"" by Cirque du Soleil is one of the best Cirque shows in Vegas (among others I've been to here was the Ka show, also amazing)!"
As always loved my hair always feel glamorous and get so many compliments on  my hair thanks to my top stylist Oscar!!!
"This airport is my worst enemy. It was my first time here and I had the worst experience ever. We had cancellations on top of delays on top of more delays. We had to stay overnight because the airport had to close down a landing strip(?) due to construction...So the airport could not handle the amount of air traffic that was coming in and out so they decided to cancel flights. Flights are pre-scheduled/booked months in advance...so why schedule flights to the airport if the airport can't handle it? Idk. 

Also, Air Canada's terminal is tiny. Better get food before you go to your gate bc there's literally 2 restaurants there. 

Other than that. Everyone at Delta was super accommodating and helpful in all the chaos. There was one delta employee that helped my friend and I so much but I don't know his name. To this Delta representative, thank you so much for all that you did for us!"
"Note: CASH ONLY!

Across the river, I found a home, place where not everyone may know my name, but where they all share the same obsessive love affair with the same music I do. 

After months of being coaxed into attending some shows at Pittsburgh's smaller venues for a change, I made it a point to catch the loaded line-up of Mud City Manglers, Argus, Carousel, and the headliners, Chicago's High Spirits, and it was an experience that rivaled a religious awakening. 

I must have struck up conversations with at least 5 people simply over the vintage Scorpions t-shirt I had on, and this was before I got into the concert venue itself! 

Adjacent to the the bar, the stage is anterior to the ex-storefront, meaning bands can get their equipment in and out through the back of the stage onto the sidewalk without having to navigate narrow corridors. And until the glass gets fogged up, one can watch the concert from outside, window shopping for rock if you will. 

The sound was tremendous, the camaraderie was unmatched, and the loud, sultry, voltaic fun had was staggering, all underneath a quilt of old t-shirts within a humble dive that for too long I dismissed. 

New friendships were formed, older ones reinforced, brains were rattled, spines tingled when familiar songs began their strains -- for several hours I was in my Avalon, my Valhalla, my element. 

I had a more enjoyable concert experience here than I have at ones held at much bigger, state-of-the-art facilities. No fireworks, light, fog, or stage props were necessary. 

It was Saturday night alchemy. 

It was Howlers, and I need to be here more often. A friend of mine lives just around the corner. How privileged he is...

Bring Bourdain here and win him over."
"We have been taking our dog here since we got him, and we really like this store.  We went to Kathy for Intermediate and Advanced classes, and she was so wonderful, and our dog Oliver adored her.  Everybody in the store is very friendly.  We recently took Oliver here for a grooming, and we just loved everybody in the grooming salon as well.  All groomers the were so friendly, and accommodating.  Oliver also came out looking like a million bucks, so big thanks to everyone that helped groom him.  The only thing I regret is not taking Oliver here in the first place.  The drive is 100% worth it for us."
Came here to celebrate my friend's and my birthday and Rosie has been the only one who has been amazing we didn't met her till 1:00 am  Thank you so much Rosie and the fantastic Dj for such a great time we'll as I was typing this our friend  got kick out because  they said no hats .Well he's back so  thank you for let us continue the celebrate  !! Big shout out to Rosie !!!  It's 4:35 am 4 stars for Dj and Rosie
"HORRIBLE! We waited 5 weeks for a repair to be done, that's after they ordered the part. We had two items needing repair. After 1 part came in they would not come fix the one appliance unti the other part came in for the second appliance. I have now gone 5 weeks without a washing machine and 4 weeks without a microwave. HORRIBLE and the don't care if you complain."
"I signed my friend up 13 days ago. no visit to date.  trying to call now, I've been on hold over 15 minutes.  this is not the way to run a business, especially a health care one."
"Excellent show and venue at the Mirage.  The performers are amazingly talented and you are taken back in time through fabulous music and imagery.  Everything is so colorful and beautiful.  We saw the show this month and had seats very close to the back and it was still amazing.  I typically like to be closer but we were able to score these tickets last minute.  During the show they also have videography on a very large screen depicting many real life clippings and videos that had been going on during the time when the music took place.  One of the screens during one song showed the KKK and that was certainly part of that time unfortunately. What I found disturbing was that the show elaborated on that in a very theatrical way.  They had performers dressed in KKK garb that looked a bit cartoonish with a cross that appeared to be burning center stage.  I personally was very disturbed by this depiction and am very surprised more people are not commenting on this.   I respect the videography but this seemed unnecessarily gratuitous.  That being said, I can also say even my teenage children seemed to like the show and they were not Beatles fans.  This is clearly a 5 star show if only that representation on stage hadn't occurred."
"Been living around this place for several years and never noticed it until I saw a small sign on the side of the road that caught my eye. Well, even with the sign just a block away pointing to the shop, it was blocked by another building that made it difficult to spot, going south on Jones blvd.

Disappointing orders:

Eggs Benedict: A pretty straightforward dish that consists of english muffin, layered with a slice of canadian bacon/ham, poached egg and the most important - hollandiase sauce. What would make or break the dish would certainly be the hollandaise sauce. Well, from experience with more than a handful of different versions of ""eggs benedict"" dishes I've had in the past, their sauce wasn't great or even good in my opinion. The home fried potatoes weren't any better..

Ortega Burger: Came with chili, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese and jalapeno mayonnaise. I didn't think I could've gone wrong with this one but it wasn't nearly as satisfying as the description. The meat was on the dry side, the chili was blah and I didn't notice anything special with their jalapeno mayo spread. Fries were fine, better than anything else offered this morning. I'd rather have Carl's Jr's.  ""Santa Fe"" Chicken sandwich over this any day.

Service was great, prices weren't good for quality nor quantity, decor was island casual and food was lacking in all aspects"
"Pretty decent sushi. However, I much prefer the Sushi Mon in Henderson. For some reason, the food tasted fresher. However, good place to enjoy an all-you-can-eat sushi place. Again, they include a lot of appetizers on the AYCE menu. Yay!"
"So this place comes highly recommended!! It is behind my favorite Thai/Vietnamese place (Viet-Thai) and once night we thought we'd check it out.

We had a couple rolls of sushi and I had the Panko crusted Chicken and the boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken. Everything was good, but I wasn't blown away. I really wish the salad had a ginger dressing and I  may ask if they have it next time, but it has a sesame dressing. I hear they have the best Ramen in town and over half of the patrons were japanese!! That speaks volumes...  FYI he loved the place but didn't think his chicken was the best. We both agreed we'd be back to try the Ramen and Udon!!"
"This was my 2nd time here. The 1st time was on a Tuesday night, this time a Friday night.

Service was good from the bartender Keisha. But not from the rest of the staff. One of the bar hops came by and cleared off my drink before I was done with it. 

Our food took over an hour to come out. While we were waiting my friend asked to speak with the manager about how long we had been waiting. He had excuse after excuse as to why it was taking so long.

When the food finally came out, the burger that my friend ordered medium rare came out well done so she sent it back and she waited another hour and a half til it came back out.

In the end our food was comped and we only paid for our drinks.

I read other reviews which seem like a general consensus that this place could use some tweaking. I see the potential so I really hope they get it together."
"I have had some good experiences and some bad. Customer service tends to be unimpressive, at best. The first time I went there I was with a friend who lived in the area. Minutes after sitting down, one of the hostesses literally threw a piece of folded paper at my friend. It asked if she was not on a date, would she like to go out with said hostess. Super unprofessional, especially at the beginning of a meal. The second time, I asked the server if the beans were prepared or merely tossed in a dish, he responded ""well don't all beans come from a can?"" and walked away. Service the rest of the night was slow despite it being low volume and the server continued to be rude when faced with questions or requests. Will not be returning. Poor quality food and awful service."
"I have no idea what Mike B. is talking about...then again, I see the date of his review and smile...

My friends and I had been going to PD's for a good few years now.  When it first came onto our radar, it was a half-decent place (although very dark) with great specials.  $1 dollar ""You Call Its"" and $2 dollar pitchers of Yuengling.  The smoke was a little overwhelming but you could ignore that because of the specials...plus the wait staff was friendly and helpful.  Then it all went downhill from here.  The familiar staff disappeared along with the dart machine.  More and more seedy characters started frequenting the place...and before long, the specials vanished!

Yes, I do mean vanished...when the owner/manager was asked about the $2 dollar pitchers, he claimed they never existed - that it was a figment of our imagination.  I don't really know what to say about that...but I haven't been back here in a year - almost two.

Based on Mike B.'s review, I guess they expanded the food menu which is nice but I've heard their drinks have gone up in price and they still allow people (illegally?) to smoke inside.  I also heard the pool tables were taken out.

Overall, if you're looking for a good bar - hit up Hough's in Greenfield - it's not much farther away and has a great atmosphere, no smoking and fantastic beer on tap (good specials too!).

Final verdict = 1.5 stars"
"Catching a late lunch has it's risks. The sign said 11-4 or ""until they're sold out"". Unlikely. And how can you survive on being open 4 hours a day, 5 days a week?!? This joint has definitely figured out how to do just that. After doing yelp check ins for several months, this place deserves that I take the time to post a review. Not that they need it! Pulling in at 3pm surely meant there would not be a problem but the staff were shutting down! The pit master was kind enough to make a plate of pork and grits. Everything smoked meat should be and the grits were perfect! The house made sauces are wonderful. I even had the pecan pie- Delish! I was granted a tour of the smoke pits (work of art) and even snapped a few pics and asked for a hug. Thanks guys for making my visit incredible!  I am in a LMB coma... Ann"
Happy to see this in our hood! Just tried it today and loved the pasta; and my friend requested an off-the-menu salad which they accommodated. I'll be back often.
"I stopped here on a house hunting tour. I was tired and hungry. 

I sat down to a quiet meal. I ordered a Stella on tap and chicken tikka masala. 

The food was good; the beer was cold. I was starting to relax....BUT....

A family walked in with a baby and a 2 year old. The two year old would not stop screaming. He was obviously tired and needed to be at home. Both parents were oblivious to this and sat there anyway. The waitress didn't help...she went to play with the baby. 

By this tine, the restaurant was crowded with ADULT diners. This family disrupted every single diners' meals with their screaming children.

To make matters worse, I wasn't even halfway through my meal when the waitress slapped the check on my table and told me to notify her if ""I needed a box"". 5 minutes later, another waitress picked up the bill and asked if ""I were ready to cash out"". No, I am not finished with my meal!!!! Good grief. 

Persis, good food, could be great atmosphere, but wow...."
"Horrible service, we waited 3 hrs + for a part that was wrongly ordered. I'm never going back... You shouldn't either."
"was in the area so decided to check out Smashburger.  I went in before the lunch rush so can't judge how the service was, the place was empty around 11am. Looked clean although there was some noise going on - an employee banging on something, have no idea what it was, a machine or icemaker or something.  Who knows?  Anyway, I chose the BBQ burger with bacon and cheese. Regular size. Also had a side of haystack onions. Order was done quickly and took it to go.  Okay, here's my opinion on this burger.  I liked the bun - a nice change from the typical fast food bun, so that was nice.  The bacon had a nice flavor, and I thought the burger itself was well balanced in terms of BBQ, cheese and onions (maybe a bit low on onions but not too bad).  Here's the bad part:  my burger was pink in places. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and definitely would have had it well done as I do NOT eat hamburger meat with ANY pink in it whatsoever.  (and yes, a burger can be cooked well done without drying out, if I can do it at home for myself, a professional cook ought to be able to).  So, I was unhappy and grossed out by the pink areas. Various people have said the food is greasy.  I didn't find that to be a problem.  In fact, I like a burger with a bit of grease sheen, so that was a plus for me. I did find the haystack onions to be on the salty side.  Not horribly so but a bit more saltiness than I would like (was rather thirsty after finishing the meal).  The meat itself in the burger didn't taste all that wonderful.  Just so so, a bit more quality than a typical fast food McD's type thing, but not soooo much that it knocked me out.  There were bites that just didn't taste that wonderful.  And every now and then the haystack onions had a bit ""off"" flavor also (like old oil).  Would I go here again?  Probably not.  If they lowered everything on the menu by a dollar, maybe.  I understand what they are aiming for, a somewhat higher quality burger than fast food, but until they can cook a burger without leaving pink in it, I would never eat here again.  It's a shame because they are on the right track somewhat, but like so many places, they aren't quite there, and in this economy, leaving with a bill of over $8.00 for one person, for two items, is probably not going to bring back a lot of people.  They seemed friendly from the way I was greeted, so no complaints there, but like I say, it was early in the day and no one else was there.  I'd like them to succeed but at lower prices and fully COOKING the meat, then they might get a loyal customer :)"
"I stopped taking my mother who was 90 at the time to Dr Nafisi because I suggested to him to check my mothers vitamin D level because it helps to keep your bones, heart and immune system to work better.  He replied that she is too old to need to worry about it.  I so badly wanted to say that he wouldn't do that if it was his mother.  I instantly decided to find a more concerned doctor for my mom.  I also realized that his demeanor had always been that he was not particularly concerned and seemed more or less bored."
"For Chinese food and for what you get, I thought it was overpriced. Got the curry beef on rice and eggplant minced pork with a bottle of water and the total came out to $23 before tip. There was very little beef in the curry and just didn't think the value was there. Was quick and the eggplant was tasty/greasy, but probably wouldn't return."
"This company is racist. If you are a minority, try getting your ping equipment serviced like lie angle or length for example and see if you get a honest service at the Phoenix headquarters. Or see if you get rejected by the fitting people there."
"do not buy a bonsai tree from sheridan nurseries especially if its a bonsaistore.ca or a tropex.ca brand product

it will die and they wont warranty it

just water it once a week, give it light and fertilize it once a month and it should be a happy bonsai...wrong the plant is dead when you buy it

no customer service and $40 thrown away

this is my third attempt to a bonsai tree and i give up

sorry sorry sorry but its out of warranty is the common phrase from the reseller and the maker of this tree

its just a pine tree in a cup and not a real bonsai

my kids got me this as a gift and are sad that they do not have the tree they wanted dad to have...they have a brown tree"
"Finally went and tried out the place. Very easy to find as it was directly across from my friend's house. 

The space is gorgeous! Open floor plan, cute wooden tables and the decor is very clean. Love the greenery in the room. The big windows for sunlight makes for great pictures.

Food was decent. I ordered the pancakes which were very light, fluffy and flavorful. Definitely didn't need syrup with the house made sauce they put on it. 

My friend's steak and eggs were greatly presented. Never been a fan of precut steak as I love to cut it myself, but their presentation of stacking it like a jenga stack was a breath of fresh air from the nornal sliced at an angle and fanned out on the plate like most places do with precut steak. Chimichurri was good. Their rainbow smashed fingerling potatoes reminded me too much of CRAFTkitchen's smashed breakfast potatoes. However, theirs could not hold a candle to the aforementioned restaurant. The potatoes lacked the crunchiness and creaminess. And the marinade made it look messy, not clean on the plate.

My friend who ordered their breakfast burrito, I am just a person of aesthetics... for the price he paid, I'm sure the cooks could've rolled that burrito tighter and actually put more filling... you can definitely tell there was no care put in to that burrito of how flattened it looked. I've rolled enough burritos and sandwich wraps to know how much filling and care goes in to making one.

All of the food was overshadowed by service. I'm sorry, if you're going to provide a refill service your tea, at least be attentive to your floor. Just as it was pictured in another review, servers still had their backs towards their guests. I understand it's not a full service restaurant, but if I'm going to pay for a $3.75 glass of tea that isn't that big to begin with, people do expect a refill. I'm fine with refilling my water. I do it whenever I am at Crepe Expectations.. but even if you moved to refillable teas as the server made a point to inform me, ""Oh I'm sorry, we just changed from non free refills to free refills,"" then please don't keep your back to your guests and just stand there with your elbow on the counter chatting away with your coworker. 

On another off the subject, I now understand their 15% option on their payment for tips. Here's a tip for those complaining about the service after paying: don't pay the tip on the card of you're hell bent on complaining why the tip option is available (based on another reviewer complaining about it). You can easily put no tip and just leave money on the table. 

I'll still come and check out the rest of the food, because it was great. Just like Pho Saigon 8 in Henderson: you know you're going to get bad service but you suck it up for the good food (however, their service has improved as of late - the server who ignores you doesn't work there anymore haha). I am in the area frequently so yes I will still support because of the good food, but I hope service standards get improved upon."
"This is why I wait to review. The VA dentist told me that he would work with me once my va stuff was approved. The front office who is just fabulous (insert sarcasm) interrupt me while I'm telling them my issue and that the dentist told me he would work with me since I'm moving out of state. I wouldn't believe anything that comes out of their mouth. Thanks for nothing summerhills dental!!! I've spoke with the VA at Pecos and let them know :) Summerhill dental will get irritated if you explain a situation, they interrupt you, and you call the lady by ma'am.. It's quite interesting!"
"It's like a less organized Chipotle, but with better food. Loved the al pastor! I got mine in a bowl, but next time I'll probably get it in tacos. Lots of options, but the ordering was a little googly."
"We made the mistake of going in this Fatburger on the strip, The place was packed.
We kept hearing how great the burgers are here. I have to say we did not think
they were anything special. At least we did not think so. They are just a hamburger and we didn't see anything so fat about them.
The place was so busy not one place to sit down. I think In & Out is much better than this place and taste much fresher.
Unless we ordered the wrong burger... Plus it took awhile with them being so busy, 
I think I will stick to In & out when I want a burger fast. 
I would not come back here to this location its just not a place for locals even when you come to the strip, Maybe sometime try a different location.
Not our favorite place."
"The average rating is due to the lack of ambience. It's very loud, the tables are too small and close together. If you go request a booth in the bar. They also don't accept reservations so be prepared to wait on busy nights.

They have an excellent beer selection and  our server was very knowledgeable and helped us pick great beers.

The portions are very large. I had the soup and half grilled cheese special. You have your choice of soups and I picked the classic combo of tomato and grilled cheese. The tomato soup was very good and satisfying. The grilled cheese was larger than a half sandwich.  Grilled sour dough, gooey cheese and bacon done to perfection. 

My husband started with a cup of chorizo chili. Excellent choice. His bacon cheeseburger came medium rare as requested. The French fries were pretty average. 

They have an interesting menu and I'm looking forward to going again. We'll ask for a booth in the bar."
"Great location. Affordable prices. Wonderful staff. 

My sister and I got our hair done at Blowout Dollhouse for New Year's Eve! By far the best price in Las Vegas for a blowout and the cotton candy champagne was a nice little treat while being pampered. The stylists were amazing and very personable. The energy of the staff is just amazing and totally contagious. Having my hair done here was by far one of my favorite experiences while my sister was in town. 

My only issue was that I was not asked if I wanted to spend the extra $10 to get curls in my hair after the blowout. I would have said yes but would have been nice to know that there was an extra cost. 

Tip: the front desk is kinda of hidden around the chairs! We got confused on where to check in but the stylists were eager to point us in the right direction! 

Definitely a place all ladies should check out!"
"I recently dined here for a special occasion.  The staff was courteous and the food, while pricey, was delicious.  The reason I have rated this restaurant with only two stars is because of their seafood choices.  Their offerings are NOT eco-friendly.  Most of their seafood is on the AVOID list according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program.  They would do well to align their menu with choices that are good for our oceans and ecosystems.  I will not be dining here again."
"Do you like Indian food? Are you looking for something near ASU? Is it lunchtime? then come here for the buffet already--you're welcome.

I only have done lunch here, and I've done it often so I cannot speak to the actual menu. If I had any complaints I would say the buffet options are a bit limited, but really they have all my favorites and OH MY does it all taste good. The bread (naan) is also addicting."
"Good place to take your pet. People who work here seem professional and well trained. They did a good job even with my crazy lady, who it seems has never been groomed in her life! Thank you guys, I know it can't be easy with some dogs!"
"My wife and I decided to give this place a try for our special occasion anniversary dinner. As we walked in, three females (appearing to be hostess's) stood and looked at us as we came through the door. Blankly awkwardly staring as if we were coming to rob the place! We decided to sit outside as it was a beautiful evening. Our server was very nice and friendly but sort of lost on many things. We ordered appetizers.... one came under cooked - one came over cooked. Oh well, no big deal. My wife ordered a glass champagne and it arrived like it came out of a box. Warm glass, no fizz, and tasteless. We had asked to sample before, but the server said we couldn't because that would force them to open a new bottle and that couldn't be done. 

Whatever..... 

I ordered the bone in ribeye, it came mediocre at best. Sitting neatly to the side of the steak was a foil wrapped, starch riddled baked potato. One bite and it was shoved to the side of the plate. The dinner salad was limp, flavorless and the texture of the blue cheese dressing looked like it was squeezed out from a tube!! We ended with desert, the pumpkin bread pudding. It was soggy, mushy and gooey with cheap cinnamon sprinkled about the plate. We ordered two double cappuccino's and they were terrible!! Literally almost spit it out. But worse of all, was the disgusting smokers who seem to congregate RIGHT in front of the outside table seating area.... puffing their smoke and making us gag while trying to eat. This wasn't just once, but multiple times throughout the evening, smoker after smoker after smoker leaving a cloud of nicotine throughout the entire patio area. Overall I would never go back to this place. If you're craving a steak dinner, you'd have a better plate served at Denny's. Guaranteed!!"
"Had the opportunity to dine at Unwined on a recent Saturday evening with another couple.  We were in search of a restaurant in the Ahwautukee area and decided on Unwined based on Yelp reviews and the picture of the S'mores Dessert pictured on their website!

Upon arrival we were greeted by Cory who was also our server.  The decor is inviting and somewhat homey.  The tin ceiling tiles is a nice touch.  Although one of my fellow diners thought the tiles were plastic made to look like tin.  If so, they did the trick!  There were a few people at the bar and a few other tables occupied.  This didn't change during the evening.  Unwined also has live music however not on the night of my visit.  I wonder what the noise level would be like with music and the 'tin' ceiling tiles.  I'll need to make a return visit to check it out.

We skipped appetizers and ordered our entrees ... salmon salad, cheese & meat board with a salad, French pig (prok chop) and scallops.  Since the S'mores Dessert was one of the reasons we selected Unwined, we indulged and were quite glad we did.  We also enjoyed a 2012 Silver Palm Zinfandel.  With tip the total bill was $180.00 or $45 per person.  While a bit pricey, all diners enjoyed their meals.

A few notes, for some reason the scallops didn't come with a salad; the diner ordered one when he determined 5 scallops weren't going to be satisfying.  The diner who ordered the French pig asked for a Caesar salad instead of a dinner salad.  Cory wasn't sure if the substitution could be made.  It wasn't and he didn't comment about it.  Perhaps he forgot when he got back to the kitchen.  Finally, the S'mores Dessert is highly recommended!  The dessert is served in a skillet with a bed of graham crackers, melted chocolate chips and topped with marshmallows!  The skillet sits on a board with additional graham crackers.  Cory offered to bring additional graham crackers if needed.  

A nice neighborhood restaurant!

Be sure to check out the reviews written by my critic in food, Knife of Knife 'n Fork.  Bon Appetite!"
"Great spot on Coxwell near O'Connor.

Everything is made in house -- sandwiches, salads and some great sides.
Lots of good looking local micro-brews on tap.
Friendly staff who really know their fare.
Pretty casual -- you order from the board, pay, and then take a seat. 
They bring it out to you when ready.

We had the Chicken Sandwich -- so flavourful and topped with a great slaw!  Hubby had fries and I had the tater tots as sides (talk about a blast from the past and great!).
They make their own ketchup and have a spicy version too which went great with the tater tots.

The food was great quality and I totally recommend if you are looking for a more casual lunch.  Think I might have to try the Shrimp Po'Boy next time or perhaps the Steak and Cheese Sandwich. :)"
"This is a great place to go to for a taste of ""nona's cooking"" as my friend would say. The food has a that authentic home cooked meal feel to it, with all the dishes having a no fuss, hearty goodness taste. The pastas that we've had there are cooked amazingly well and full of flavour, but again not fancy with unnecessary ingredients. 
Their mealball is amazing, as are the seared scallops and every meat dish we've had there is great. 
The ambiance and servers make the place great. it's casual and fun but still a nice night out. The servers are attentive and knowledgeable."
I stopped in to window shop. Ill be purchasing from them soon. The selection was great and the staff was friendly folks who love guns.  I would like to welcome them to the neighborhood.  The prices on ammo were in line with most other gun stores but they had it in stock. This place will get 95% of my business and i highly recommend them to everyone purchasing a firearm.
"Wanted to goto a Waffle House since we dont have any around us in california.  We chose this one because it was in North Phoenix and hoping it was a little nicer then some of the others we drove by. It didnt matter, i guess a waffle house is a waffle house. They had some teenager cooking the food and we where wondering how the food was going to come out, well the bacon was black and burnt, atleast the waitress asked us before we said anything about it. So she got us some more bacon and this time it was just under cooked. The egg's were not cooked all the way. The waffles where good and the hash browns where good if you didnt eat the burnt parts. Might try it again but maybe a different location"
"We eat here occasionally with friends and family. 
This place as with all Cracker Barrels are pretty much the same. I guess that is why there is usually a crowd especially on holiday. 
Their food is consistent. If you want to substitute an item on the menu for something else you may not be able to. After you eat or while you are waiting to be seated there is the store with a bunch of stuff your wife will want to look at. 
They do take reservations but if it is a holiday be prepared to still wait an hour to be seated. This is what happened the last time we went there."
"The set up is a bit confusing, where you order on the other end rather than the cash registers. You kind of have to repeat your orders like 3 times. I didn't care too much for the food here. My husband gets the wreck it or whatever. The kids got a turkey sandwich and I got the uptown salad. The lettuce was wilted in my salad. Can't say I'd go again."
"So I kept hearing so much about the Country Club Grill at the Wynn and I have been extremely eager to dine there for a while. I mean there are murmurs that this place Steve Wynn's favorite place in the hotel so this really has to be a knockout of a place right? You wouldn't waste the view overlooking the entire golf course with something mediocre right? This is the Wynn which is supposed to be the Las Vegas best of the best RIGHT?

Sadly wrong on all counts and lets just say I was thoroughly let down. So much so I have turned 2 people away from eating here already. Look if I ruin how I feel about the meal this early in the review you have to know it was just that lackluster...

So I made a reservation as it was advised this place can get very busy and it was a Friday afternoon. I walked in and was greeted pleasantly by the team at the front podium and was sat very promptly.  My table was at the glass and no matter where you sit you have a great view of the entire Wynn golf course.  The chairs were even real comfy which was just a great sign that they wanted to think every detail through of your dining experience. Things were looking up, right?

Our waiter came and dropped of the menu and an option vegan menu. It took me a second but, then I realized there was no wine or drink menu. I asked the waiter for this and it was brought over in a relatively timely manner. The actual menu is simple and covers pretty much every option you would expect for lunch dining with more than 3 items on it that looked good. When the waiter came back we ordered a nice white wine from France to get things started. This is sadly where things started to slide downhill. The waiter pinged back and forth a few times before I waived him down and gave him my food order (for me tomato & mozzarella salad and the chicken club sandwich). After a while of wondering where my wine was the waiter informed us that they didnt have what was ordered and brought a bottle of something from Oregon and a different varietal. Now let me stop here if I was at the Olive Garden this wouldnt be a big deal but the reputation and more importantly the PRICE of this place means they are held to a higher standard. The bottle was declined and I asked for an alternate on the menu. The waiter seemed confused. The wine list isnt very long so knowing whats on it should not be that hard.

Now the first course came out (salad for me and soup for my companion) and I was eager to try the food. Sadly another let down as my salad was just bland. I had to waive down the waiter for salt as there was none on the table. So up until this point if you read my review you might think I was real picky and just kind of a harsh critic but, really what it comes down to is again at this price level you have certain expectations and they were being dragged down in a very fast fashion. Finally the wine was brought out and I was able to enjoy it alongside my food. And that is when my waiter disappeared for about 15 minutes. So whenever I ran out of wine I had to reach over and do it myself.

The main course came out from the kitchen which looked amazing and we were still having to constantly refill our own wine. Now the chicken sandwich had a real good flavor of well cooked chicken, the sauces, and the soft bread. Really this was the only positive part of the meal and its saving grace for me. My dining companion ordered an item off the vegan menu (a mushroom napoleon)  and was unfortunately let down by the flavor.

I really cant tell you how much I wanted to like this place and maybe thats why I am so let down. Sub par service and so so food make this place a must skip as far as I am concerned. Wish that wasnt the case!"
"The atmosphere is great! Quaint little place in the heart of downtown. Food was good, but on the whole, nothing especially stands out. We ordered the jalepeno bomb, which is worth it. The spicy tuna and salmon were good, but you can't really mess those ones up. The rainbow roll was, well, a rainbow roll. Good. The yellowtail lover I was really looking forward to bc of all the reviews on here, but it was a little underwhelming. The plain spicy salmon and tuna rolls were better. The fried icecream was delicious though, and pretty presentation. It's big enough to share. Service was good...and until a larger louder party came in, the place was perfect for a nice quiet evening out."
The manager wasn't very accommodating. There was a damaged item that I inquired about and I asked if they were able to put a discount on it since the packaging was almost completely destroyed but they still wanted full price for damaged goods. I don't recommend going to this one.
"If you are in the mood for the delicate fried arts, seafood and spuds (aka. Fish and Chips) this is the place for it.
 
Sea Witch focuses on the old fashioned ways of frying, with full flavor, quality ingredients and special preparation. Adding a hint of modern creativity, the results are noticeably different and very delicious.

Halibut is the name of the game here, as it should when you batter any fish. However, the option is yours, you can go with haddock, cod, arctic char, pickerel, if your heart's desire.  In a sandwich, a la carte or with chips, that's your call too. The fish is Ocean Wise certified and everything here is fried in Beef tallow for full flavor goodness.

On my tasting menu:

The Witch's Brew, Fish Chowder with Pickerel. Very filling, creamy with chunks of veg and fish. 

Onion Rings were almost donut-like. Giant rings, lots of flavor and very crispy. Almost meal worthy!

The Classic Halibut Fish and Chips is a model version of what FnC should be. The batter is crispy, light, flavorful and not overwhelming or greasy. The halibut is fresh, tender and moist. The combination is perfect, the chips add to the experience. The tallow really does work on the spuds, making them beyond addictive. Overeating will occur.
 
Overall, Sea Witch brings the FnC game. Everything was great, fried well, prepared well and served with a smile. A great place to stop in and share a meal."
Usually im okay with their food but today i ordered chili cheese fries with onions and not too much shredded cheese on top. So they gave me cheese fries... melted cheese and whole onions. No chili on my chili cheese fries... and couldnt even chop the onions
"The service was awesome, no complains at all. They're very attentive, very accommodating & fast. But the food... the tempura was good, the sushi's not really.. the rice wasn't good, was too thick, just small amount of imitation crab meat, almost all their sushi's has cucumber in it, the quality of their fishes was't good either. we can't even finish our order because it really was not good."
"Love the wedge on neil. We tried the wedge 2 on winsdor, love it! Food is great and the drinks are awesome. Can't wait to use the patio in the summer."
"Just had dinner here after our normal Vietnamese place was close. This place was great. Their menu was big with a lot of different options. My hubby got the 1-in1 which had tuna, salmon, crunch and avocado. It was amazing. A friend got the hot roll which he liked and they split a Mexican roll which had a jalapeÃƒÂ±o pepper on top. It was fresh, unique and delicious. This was a great find and well worth a second visit."
I have been going to this dentist for many years. The front desk staff are great. Dr. Atwal & Dr. Pirbhai have been fantastic to me. The hygienists are also wonderful. I have never had a bad experience there.
"I purchased a gift certificate for a facial for my wife for Mothers Day and a massage for my daughter who flew in for the weekend from Philadelphia.  They were both extremely pleased with their services.  Here's the reason for the low rating: the facial was supposed to be a surprise.  Our daughter coming into town was also supposed to be a surprise.  I came into the spa to buy the certificate and made it clear that all of this was supposed to be a surprise.  So they call my wife on Friday to confirm the facial for her and the massage for our daughter.  Surprise was totally ruined.  Again, the services were great but the front desk totally dropped the ball."
"I've been here multiple times but recently I invited a set of friends and it was their first time. I have to say I was a bit humiliated thanks to the lovely but condescending staff/server. There were five of us who came. A friend was running late so the rest of us decided to order lots of food. When the server came to see our orders she felt very unsure and warned us that ""It is a little bit too much for a group of 5."" She then went on to say that ""we charge for left over food"" as if we didn't know that as we entered...

When the server said that all of our eyes widened. Come again? We all found it insulting for the server to say that it is ""a bit too much"" considering it is an ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT place. We already know the rules very well. We're not naive about this kind of service but who is she too judge that it was ""a bit too much?"" My friends and I fasted since the night before and we knew what we were doing.

Nevertheless, we felt challenged so we took her warning seriously. Two rounds of copious amount of food later, there was nothing left except the plates. If only we could eat the plates to further prove to that server that she was dead wrong! It was no wonder she was quiet when we asked for the bill. She could not even look us in the eye! How's that for a little bit too much?

But seriously... Please don't tell you're customers that their orders are too much. There is a reason why they are eating at an AYCE place - they are probably hungry af or starved themselves for a day or two!"
"I've only been for a few different alcohol tasting events. Not sure about the food or their other drinks.  

There is plenty of seating, but the area in the back where they host the tastings can get very crowded with the bottle displays. It's a bit loud in there, and it can get cold in the winter, but overall a nice location with nice staff."
"We were very disappointed with this place. We had an 8:30 reservation and the hostess said she'd be right with us while helping people who didn't have a reservation for 10 minutes. We were informed we'd have to wait until 10:15 to be sat outside, but could sit us at a table next to the window (with two fat people immediately in front of outside blocking the view). Oh well, the interior was super nice, dark and very romantic feeling. 

Our awesome busser quickly brought us three great kinds of bread, some olive tapenade and Pellegrino quickly. Our pretentious sommelier was quick to assist us, but looked down at my selection (a $125 bottle of Stag's Leap Cabernet). I got the very distinct feeling for some reason, because Im young they thought I didn't have money or something ridiculous.

Our waiter dropped off our menu and then seemed to completely forget about us. We finally waved him down and ordered the tuna tartar as non-spicy as possible, the sweet potato gnocchi and the grilled sirloin. 

The tuna tartar came out pretty quick and was very good. A little too spicy and raw for my date, but I loved it. After that, it took what seemed like forever for our food to arrive. My date loved the sweet potato gnocchi. My steak was cooked to the correct doneness, but per the usual for steakhouses, needed more salt. This, and I had no idea what it was that accompanied my steak. Server was nowhere to be found. I finally flag him down and he explains what was on my plate, but I'm not sure what this was. HAHA... I asked him for salt, but it never came. After 15 minutes or so, I flagged down the busser who hooked it up. 

We finally got the bill and got our food wrapped up. Place was incredibly overpriced for the service and quality of food is not worth it. Its the same price as Bouchon, so I would recommend anyone in Vegas to go there instead. 

Oh, all this AND they double charged me. Im still disputing that as we speak..."
"Great rub on the ribs. Little to spicy sauce but, it was tasty. Mac 'n cheese is ok. Pork and brisket sandwichs are AWESOME. Definitely coming back!!!"
"Dear Wolfgang, 

I will dream of the truffle chips with blue cheese until my next return where I plan on dropping my suitcase whenever I shall be staying and beeline for your restaurant some can have them. 

The mussels we unbelievable and I now feel challenged to try and master the fine art of cooking them so I can try to relive my dinner. 

I would give you five stars much you wine list kind of made me said in terms of variety and price. Did not stop me from enjoying two glasses of red wine. 

Save a seat for me."
"Attended a wine dinner recently. AWESOME! 
The wines and courses were exceptional. Already signed up for the next one in July."
"I am so mad because I forgot to take pictures of the food. But I must say the food itself was good. I got the chicken wings and asked for them extra crispy, and indeed they did make them  the proper way and they were delicious. My husband had the BLT sandwich, and he claimed it was good. We shared fries but I must say if we didn't eat them fast they tasted like they were frozen which is fine but I rather have that at home and not at a cafÃƒÂ©. The waitress we had was not the friendliest but not the rudest either. She made me feel that I was taking her time and I should hurry and figure out what I want to order. The place is clean but I feel like it's a little too pricey to be a cafÃƒÂ©. I would recommend this place just beware that the waitress might make you feel like you're bothering her. One last thing, I felt like it took too long for us to get our food. So if you do what we were trying to do and that was to eat before our movie, make sure you go with plenty of time or you will be forced to eat fast so you don't miss your movie."
"I am not a vegetarian nor a vegan, so I was unsure about going here. Their food was amazing!  After a friend raved about them, I thought I'd try it because I have a dairy and egg allergy, so I can't have alot of foods anymore. I had the creamy artichoke dip and the ""beef"" drunken mushroom bowl with lots of yummy veggies and pan fried noodles. The ""beef"" really tasted like the real thing! I wanted to try one of their desserts but I was full. Hmmm.... guess I need to make another trip  :-D"
"Only the second-best buffet in Vegas. I write this right after reviewing the Wynn Buffet, and I have to say, GO TO THE WYNN. We went to both buffets on consecutive nights, and I personally thought the Bellagio could do some catching up to do.

For one, the Bellagio actually seemed like a buffet. The table arrangements and decorations made it seem kinda touristy, as opposed to the classy Wynn. Albeit, the food was still great, but something seemed to be lacking when compared to the Wynn's.

Bottom line: for the same cost and wait time, go to the Wynn for your premium Vegas buffet experience."
"You get a lot of food for the price, but the food doesn't deliver. We ordered the pepperoni pretzel appetizer thinking it was going to be oven baked pretzels with pepperoni served with the cheese dip. What we got was pretzel rods from a bag with cold pepperoni slices wrapped around them. The cheese dip was good but was cold by the time it made it to the table. Major disappointment. We kept an open mind for the main entrees. My friend got the bacon Mac n cheese burger with the house fries. The burger was huge but thin and didn't have a lot of Mac n cheese on it. The fries were dusted with seasoning and were decent. It was ok but the burger and truffle fries at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant Burgr were A LOT better. I had the Caesar salad which was enormous and by far the beat dish of  the meal. The salad was freshly tossed, cold and the croutons were delicious. Overall, a lack luster experience that failed to meet expectations."
"Only the location on 4th AND ""it's not Starbucks"" is what most likely keeps the Purple ""perking"".

Service and the care factor was not very high here on 02/19th at about 09:45am."
"Arena was awesome, but encountered a real jerk usher that yelled at me when I was lost . Might need to train your staff on a little etiquette and common courtesy. I don't like dropping $500 and getting treated crappy."
"Me and my friend figured it's Paris Casino, it should have good steak houses in here. We were walking around and come upon this place, peeked in and it looked all fancy. Thought we had to dress up to dine here. Nope, we went in got a table.  Very fancy inside, white table cloth, peaceful environment. 

She ordered some dozen oysters and a filet mignon. I ordered the main tail lobsters (2) and some beer, and got a veggie appetizer.

The appetizer was amazingly good. Her filet mignon was delicious. The waiter came out with my lobsters and gave me 4 tails instead of 2 indicating because the tails were too small, they gave me 4! I was eating it and the lobster was VERY VERY hard and tasted like rubber. I just ate most of it as i thought this was how it was suppose to taste. It's $79 lobster so it can't be cooked wrong right? Wrong.. My gf asked when the lobster tasted like rubber and the waiter said it wasn't suppose to taste like that. Overcooked. he yelled at the chef and only refunded us $21.

They should of refunded us the whole $79 for crappy overcooked lobster where I can get the same crappy lobster at Red Lobster for under $23 !

Don't ever eat lobster at a steak house in las vegas, my own fault. haha"
"After being a Faithful customer of FOX Car Rental for a while .  I get there on Friday, June 30th. to pick up my rental . The Supervisor even  come over to speak  while I was being helped by Joe.  I have always had a  pleasant experience with Fox until Friday. Joe pulled up the reservation and  5 mins later told me I could'nt rent that I didn't  pass the credit score  VERY LOUD ; of course I was the focus.

I rented in March 2016 and twice before that. If you don't want to be EMBARRASSED, make sure you have a good score.  Oh, BTW,  ENTERPRISE WON me BACK I'M ROLLING in a VERY NICE GMC SUV. THE  FOX is lie."
"They catered a community event this week and it was make your own tacos. I have got to go back! The chicken tacos were very simple just tortillas, chicken, three choices of salsa, cilantro, and lime. First of all they were amazingly simple but flavorful. Second of all the marinade the chicken was in was spicy but did not burn my tongue at all. My lips however, were close to on fire. That was the general consensus. It was unusually hot for mexican food, but totally delicious and I will be going to their restaurant."
This is one of our regular spots to eat. the employees are friendly and the food is usually really good. The hot salsa is super hot but addicting. the margaritas are giant and really good. and the fried ice cream is yummy!
It was a pleasant surprise. Food was good service was excellent and the music was great. They need to work a little bit more on flavor and portions were too small.
This is a place I can always come back to if I'm not in the mood to really do anything much at all. I like it much better when it's not packed like it is over the weekends. this is more of a middle of the week bar for me. It's nice because the venue is open and parts are outside exposed. There is a bartender there that always makes the ideal margarita for me so I cannot complain.
Half the tables were empty and they still couldn't be bothered to bring me a menu (I got my own) or even come over to take my order after 15 minutes. Ridiculously bad service.
"Overpriced, meat selection good, terrible deserts. I'll never go there again."
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE company! Professionalism.....they have NONE!
My husband and I bought a house and per the inspection there was some issues with the roof and they were to come out and fix it and the seller was to pay as to which they did. Anyways, PRS showed up and fixed a flashing in the front of the house, I asked if they were going to fix the broken tiles on the back side of the roof and the guy said "" I don't have that on my paper work"" ok, I called the office and asked them what was to be fixed and they said they could not talk to me because I was not the seller and asked if I was any relation to the seller when I answered ""no"" she very rudely said well I am not to talk to you and hung up. I am guessing it was the manager because within minutes I got a return phone call and was asked why I was upset and she said she would like to make this right and would be in contact with me......Never heard from her again. I contacted my realtor and told him he could deal with it and that I was not pleased one bit with this company. Keep in mind I bought the house and moved in Feb. 14th and this was to be fixed before I moved in...Monday a guy from PRS shows up and I'm thinking ""oh great my broken tiles are getting fixed"" WRONG! He was only here to take pictures to take back to the office and compare to what was on the home inspection. So my realtor emails Gary from PRS and asks for a refund because this is out of control....Gary tells him to chill that they would be out tomorrow to fix the broken tiles. Wow, that's how you talk to customers?!?! Today two men from PRS show up and go up on my roof to fix the broken tiles....a bit later they knock on my door and say they are done and are leaving. Great! My broken tiles are fixed.....Wrong!!!!! There are still two tiles that the corners are broken off of...... I will pay another company to come out and fix them before I ever dial their number or involve anyone with that crazy, unprofessional company ever again. If your looking for a roofing company....I would keep looking, this company is horrible in ever aspect."
The restaurant is really cool and has great food just the service is a little slow and seemed a little crazy and crowded
My juice was essentially water with a little taste of celery. Most expensive glass of water I've ever bought. Will not return.
"TIME FOR A REAL REVIEW.  

I had high hopes for this place as the the owner's brother owns a very fine Italian establishment as well.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  First off, I watched a server drop her drying rag on the floor then resumed drying off utensils with it. The food was alright.  My entree included a salad with was dressed with a balsamic vinagarette sauce.  Bread was nothing special. The chicken parmigian was a really good portion.  The red sauce was the best part of the overall dining experience.  Tiramasu tasted good for the first few bites then got unbearable because of the liquor and richness.  Canolis were had a lot to be desired.  The creamy goodness was only on the ends versus all the way through the canoli."
"Went for Thanksgiving weekend. The price a little too pricey and nothing really special for the holiday. Wasn't impressed by the dessert area, not even a chocolate fountain, a little disappointed! The food was alright. Not much seafood neither."
"Worst apartments ever. Management lies and is rude, maintenance staff is rude and they don't know what they are doing. Cockroach infested units. Air condiotning systems are breaking. 1980s appliances that barely work. I would stay very far away from here...very shady management."
"We found this plumbing contractor through Lowes when we recently purchased 3 new high efficiency toilets. Rod called in advance, showed up on time and impressed us with his 18 yrs of knowledge in plumbing. 3 beautiful installations later and we are very happy with the efficient, neat job!!"
"Love, this place!  Fatty brisket is the best, but come early enough to make sure you get some."
"This hotel is completely perfect. It is absolutely stunning from the lobby, to the casino, to the pools and suites. The housekeeping staff were so nice and thoughtful and the front desk staff and the valet staff were efficient and accommodating. One thing I'd mention is that when my son and I were looking for the Palazzo pools, we asked a Tao Beach staff member for directions and before we could even get our sentence out, he said ""can't help you. I'm busy."" Like geez. Other than our stay exceeded all of our expectations and we are already planning a weekend to come back!"
Went and got my nails dipped and a jelly pedi and it was the best decision ever!! I felt taken care of and my nails look so pretty can't wait to go back!
"Service was awesome. Many people come here to celebrate birthday. I also came here to celebrate for my friend. We ordered 1 appetizer, and 2 mignonette steak. Including drink, total bill was $130. I put 4 stars because I really didn't like coconuts shrimp. It tastes weird. Stuffed mushroom with cheese was awesome. Again service was quick and awesome. I would definitely come back again for someone's birthday."
"Met girlfriends for drinks and appetizers. Drinks were fair, and they actually did make a special order for me, although not as good as I had at other restaurants. Food was less than mediocre. We only ordered veggies quesadillas. It was cut in four pieces and the two end pieces had cheese and no veggies. We asked for extra veggies on the next order and it was a tad improved but nothing special. Service was fair to bad. The server forgot silverware, forgot extras we asked for three times, forgot to ring our check had to ask twice to get the check and she said she wondered what was in her pocket. It was the clipboard with our credit card and cash.The worst part though was sitting on the patio two of the people in the party had to face the alley and the garbage cans which, well, smelled of garbage. Won't be back anytime soon. Very disappointing."
Thank you for the amazing experience last night!  We showed up last minute with a large group of 16 people. The manager took take of us immediately. He has a large table set up within 10 minutes. They also got our drink and appetizer orders taken super quickly. The food was fantastic. Everyone in our group loved what they ordered. We will definitely be back!
"Very great gluten free options and delicious. There was pizza, pasta, appetizers, wedgies, hoagies, chicken fingers, beer/cider and they had some Gluten free desserts from the Gluuteny bakery across the street (which is also amazing). Quaint environment with nice bathrooms just incase that is imoortsnt to you.  The staff are all very kind and care about you. The only complaint we have was our food came out separate and from the first to our last person there was about a 7-10 minute difference. There were only 4 of us at the table. But the quality and taste of the food was well worth the wait so it wasnt that big of a deal and we enjoyed eachothers company"
That gyros sandwich was a disgrace to all things sandwich. If you're not going to make legit gyros and not have them pre shaven (way too thick) like your subway than don't even try to make a gyro sandwich!!! Gyros don't deserve this!!!!!
"Hmm...I'm not sure what the deal was with the technician who came to check the leak in the coil. I was told the day prior by the woman who scheduled the appointment over the phone the tech would call when en route to my home. No call until he's already arrived at my home but I'm at work so I'm not just sitting at home twiddling my thumbs waiting for you.  I leave work and when I meet him at my home, he was driving a ratty old van that didn't have a company logo or anything that let me know this was a professional company. I was met with a bad attitude from a technician who didn't even speak English well enough to articulate what he needed. He asked ME what he was coming for. Excuse me?? What is happening in The Wrong Guys office where your techs don't even know what they are coming out for? Poor communication! Too much confusion with this tech. I was very put off by this guy who a) called with a bad attitude b) had not a clue why he was coming to my home c) had to call the admin assistant for her to describe his process/procedure over the phone. What a mess!"
"I love the giant aquarium they have at the entrance and how they always have 5 dollar blackjack tables open, but for some reason, it always turns out to be the worst blackjack in vegas. Hope you have more luck than me!"
"This place has been reviewed to death, but I agree with most comments - it's a cool spot for beers and okay pub food. 

Quick summary:

1. FOOD - Lots of vegetarian options - especially for a pub. If you're sick of veggie burgers and food covered in cheese, try the curry. It's very flavourful, full of vegetables/chickpeas (not lentils - despite what the menu says). I know it goes against that 'When in Rome' logic, but whatever, I've had it twice, and it comes with mango chutney, so you can't go wrong. 

2. BEER - Excellent variety of beers on tap.I had the Denison's Weissbier - tasted just like Germany. 

3. SERVICE - Slow, but relaxing patio on quiet street makes it feel okay."
Would recommend their food to anyone.  Vary tasty and good specials.  Customer service is questionable at times.
"Addictive menu! Sweets, snacks, and a huge menu of freshly made chaat. I could eat Pani Puri until I explode! :)
Haven't tried the thali lunch special, but excited to try it soon."
"Maybe I should have got the chicken fried steak.  Because that steak I had was something else.  There was so much grease piled on top of my t-bone that I'm pretty sure I'm a likely candidate for the world's youngest triple bypass patient.  I'll admit, sometimes grease makes for good grubbin'.  But not this time.

I went on a Saturday night and there was a little bit of a wait. But our server was plenty kind.  She completely forgot our order of fried okra, but I wasn't feeling too upset about it."
"Great atmosphere for a weeknight date night. Meals were good but perhaps a bit overpriced given the execution. 

Service was on point."
Always take my 3 dogs here. They do a great job every time.  The price you pay is worth it. There might be cheaper ones but you get what you pay for here.
"Seems like a hip place. Bartender was friendly and so were the patrons. The night was halloween.  A few minutes into the experience  i was cussed at by a man who then approached me. This man was highly intoxicated and too major offense to my scarecrow costume, which he took as some racial flaunt. He presented him self with profanity and bad balance and all of my friends were disgusted. I learned that this man was the Bar owner (says the bartender). My group could not be served, and we kindly left.  My sister who lives there says this place has always had an attitude problem, and if you are not in their regular club, well, your subject to the owners discretion. Overall, it seems like a good place to eat and dine, just avoid the bar managers/ owners or pre booked events."
"I seem to end up here every time I am in Vegas. Probably because I like the foot massage across the parking lot. The Chicken Tika Masala is very good here. This most recent trip, I tried the Tika Masala with Tofu (by accident) and it was even better than the Chicken Tika!!  Service is good, but they are slow to bring the check.  I've tried the buffet before, and the section is good and food was fresh and tasty. I prefer the menu, however."
"Tasty & Tasty & Tas [2.5'd Tasty]

Wushan/Chongqing Grilled Fish(Pepper Spicy/$24.99)

----The concept of this Northern Chinese dish is simple 2-Fold*.
     First, Grill the Fish. Secondly, Stew in choice of spicy ingredients.
     Arrives to table on a Hotelpan that's heated underneath a la Hotpot.

     Add choice of Toppings($1.00) where I like to add Glass Noodles and Veg.
     The whole visual aspect is stunning feast-for-your-eyes presentation.
     Both times, I chose Live Catfish which stands best to longterm cooking.

     Definitely spicy, probably because I'm not adapt to Northern spicy yet.
     The sauce is extremely flavoured which is nice to begin with but...
     Unfortunate gets quite salty! as it condenses over the open-flame.
     I could not have too much either as I feel it's cholesterol loaded.

     At the end, some good some bad, some UGLY[Catfish].     

*Actually 3-Fold according to Wushan Methods[Marinade, Grill, Stew]

Hot and Sour Rice Noodles($4.99)

----I somewhat remember it being the Flat version of Glass Noodles
     Chewy Noodles with an initial Sourness then Spicy red Soup kicks in.
     I've always wanted to try this however wish more Toppings existed.

Last but not least....

The Restaurant is not the most pleasant to stay-awhile.
Washrooms should be avoided when possible, trust me.
Another Yelper managed to re-adjust their Booth seats.

Other places serve the Wushan/Chongqing Grilled Fish too.
The factor is that it may cost more and Catfish may not be offered.
I will let you decide what serves you best, Decor or Cost."
"I had the bagel with egg, waffle, and pancake. I found the food to be very average and I won't  be going back again."
"I went on easter Sunday because most places were packed. One of the worst places I've been to. Their food was terrible and was just overwhelming. And we asked what the waiter thought was good, but it wasnt wat we hoped for."
"Situated at the very end of the sprawling Settlers Ridge shopping/dining complex, this is a decent option for Thai fare. The service is always fast and friendly even during the lunch rush. No bar but they are BYOB friendly. I'm a curry guy and usually get the Massaman with extra veggies and coconut rice. I like it a lot. GrapeWife has tried several dishes and liked them all. The high ceiling in the dining room creates a spacious yet comfortable atmosphere. The round enclosed booth offers some privacy I you're into that. Give them a try. I think you'll be pleased."
"We wanted to try a traditional Mexican restaurant for the first time since moving to Pittsburgh from Phoenix.  Emilianos won the lottery!  The restaurant was open and clean.  We were seated right away at around 5:30 PM on a Saturday.  The chips and salsa were tasty (we love the traditional thin tortillas).  My wife ordered a sangria and I ordered a regular margarita.  Both were tasty and strong!  Wifey ordered Camarones Vallerta - we both loved it...especially the sauce.  I had fish tacos (I'm obsessed with them).  I was hoping for baja style (avacado, cabbage, pico, etc.), but they were just fried fish on tortillas with some side fixin's.  Overall, decent experience.  We will try again some day..."
"Update to my last post:

So on 09/26/18 my insurance company contacted me and informed me that they have been in touch with this dental office and this dental office was going to drop the $259 charge they were about to send me a bill for... yay! 

BUT....

That same exact day I all of a sudden had a bad yelp review at my work place.. by someone who has never truly been to the office and someone I've NEVER serviced by the name of ""Sarah C."". The review stated almost the same verbiage I also used on my original post to this office.... ""beware of this office"". Also, ""Sarah C's"" yelp was a brand new profile created and the review they left for me was the very first yelp ever made which goes to show.. that yelp was created obviously just to try and sabotage my business! Also, ""Sarah C"" did 3 other reviews at the same time (most likely to try and prove it's not a fake account) and it all happens to be at restaurants in the area of this dental office. Coincidence? I sure don't think so. This goes to show how this office truly works and how UNPROFESSIONAL AND CHILDISH this office is!! 

I have already reported the review as a FRAUDULENT review because it truly is! How dare this office create a fake account and create a fake review just because they couldn't handle the HONEST review I made on their page. Shake my head Ranch Dental Plaza!

Btw-- if you're wondering how they found my place of work it could've been by many ways: 
1. On my social media. 
2. On my ranch dental plaza paperwork.
3. By a person who works there that I'm friends with on social media"
"This was a great choice for a fast inexpensive meal. Pretty simple menu, which is something that I can appreciate. The Texas toast that is served with their combo meals or on its own is pretty freaking fantastic. The fingers were nice and juicy and the fries hot n fresh. I was not a fan of the house sauce that was served and will probably ask them next time if they have any other alternatives. My kids would probably love this place, so I'm glad it exists and will be back next time I'm in need of a quick bite to eat."
"Never have I walked out of a restaurant refusing to pay because of bad food. NEVER. Until now.

We were in a hurry so stupidly decided to just go for lunch in the first non-chain restaurant we found on St Denis. BIG MISTAKE. I sort of blame myself as if I had actually looked at this place more clearly I would have noticed how grimy and dirty the outside was. It was also completely empty despite there being hoardes of people in local competitors.

Service started out a bit weird. I asked if they had iced coffee (not on the menu) and the server replied: ''I could make you one I suppose''....Odd. Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur.

I went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!

Stupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.

The food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''. We were both that appalled. We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality.

What was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay. They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders. I think that says a lot - I got the impression we were not the first customers to have done this recently.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We really should have just gone into the Subway next door."
My husband found this place on yelp while searching for a new ice cream place. So glad we tried it. They make small batches of ice cream and the unique flavors are delicious. Butter Brickle and Choco PB Crunch are our favorites.
Today may my least favorite 4th of July ever. We have been at the Pittsburgh Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center since 3:30 a.m. We lost two of the three puppies and Amelia had to get a c-section to remove the final dead puppy. This procedure at an ordinary vet was half the cost but we had no other option. I cannot stand that places like this prey on the misfortunes of people. They are no better than the payday loan places and should be ashamed of themselves. I highly recommend that if you live in the Pittsburgh area you avoid PVSEC at all cost. I have never felt more pressure to make a bad financial decision than I did there.
This place sucks. They are slow and illiterate. I work at Caesars and they are rude to employees and make us late to return from work. They are also more expensive than other TOURIST price Starbucks locations. You're better off going to the Mirage a short walk away for better service and prices.
Good place for nice cheap dim sum. The waiters always look unhappy though. Cheer up people!
"Nice for a drink and to sit in the bar or patio..but food isn't great and is over priced with horribly small portions(including the pints).They change the menu quite often..which is great...but they seem to miss the mark...even keeping a couple simple dishes would really help them, in my opinion. However, the last time I went, the fish in chips were outstanding!! 
Hoping to go back, try something new and to give a better rating. Rooting for the port based on the location and the ambiance."
"Chili rellano burrito with their green sauce, you'll drive across town to get it one you've tried it! 

Huge burritos."
"Tried this local pub last week and was disappointed with the food and prices. Had the 'made in house' chicken fingers and fries for $17. The chicken fingers were bulk frozen to fryer. The fish and chips were long on grease and batter and short on haddock. Service was middling, with televisions at the bar showing the sports games. Not recommended if you're looking for decent comfort pub food."
"Looking for eat in Chinese - and NOT a buffet.  Pleasantly surprised.  Not many tables filled so service was very good.  Food was great! We've been in the area for a little over a year and this is the first independent restaurant that reminded us of the NJ taste we used to enjoy.  Hot and sour soup was nice and tangy with a hint of spicy.  Moo shu pork was good - prefer the cabbage sliced really thin, but theirs will do.  Also wonton soup with 4 little tender dumplings and beef and broccoli not bad!  Portions were large - leftovers for lunch.  We will be back!"
"If you are super hungry and passing by a Biriyani house, you should drag yourself to it! You will love it, no matter how they make it. 
PS. Good taste and also good portion according to the reasonable price!"
"Had boneless wings mild buffalo sauce. 
It was good except I could not taste the sauce at all. 
The music was to loud for my taste, and with the bare floors it had an echo to it."
"The tortilla chips are the best I have ever had! The guac and salsas are good, too. The mild salsa isn't so mild in my opinion but I really like it! My fav thing to get is the al pastor pork vampiro. I love it! The sauces on it are good as is the crunch of the tostadas. I have had it with and without the pineapple and I like it both ways. I tried the chorizo taco and it wasn't for me. The horchata drink is good - a refreshing quench after some hot salsa. I will be coming back! 

Mmmm chips and salsa....."
"This room is outdated! The lights were not working properly when we first entered the room and we had to harass maintenance to fix the issue. There were creepy clothing pieces being displayed in the room,  which meant a waste of space that could've been utilized for a necessity, like a microwave or a mini fridge. The bed was very comfortable, and pretty much the only reason why I gave this establishment 2 stars. I'll probably never return!"
Went here for the first time this morning. Everything was amazing! I got the corn beef hash and my husband got the bacon avocado omelette. Both entrees are very good. And oh my god their banana bread is to die for seriously! The food came out hot and fresh and the servers were sooo nice and friendly! I'm giving this a five star cause they deserve it! I will be coming back probably every week now lol.
"Love the onion tarte, and the tagliatelle with rabbit was good...the poutine needed more cheese and gravy though!  I like the beavers choice poutine much better!  Overall, was great with good deals for happy hour on starters and drinks!"
When I arrived my vehicle was not ready and there was an actual paper waiting list for customers to get a car.  The staff was rude and unprofessional.  The location seemed very shady and customers personal information was visible to everyone.  Some customers had been waiting hours for a vehicle.  I decided to cancel my reservation with this company!  I will never use them and will not recommend this location to anyone. Terrible experience!
"I bought about $35 of Russell Stover chocolate for Christmas stocking stuffers.
Every box disgustingly stale."
"Cafe Bene is probably my cousin's favorite place to study or chill. When I really miss Korean desserts or just the environment of a Korean cafe, Cafe Bene is the place to go. I always go to New York/Toronto  with my family and I stop by Cafe Bene. This is such a cute and spacious place to catch up with your friends or have a hard-core study session. What I usually get is the shaved ice dessert. For those who don't know what it is... it is probably the BEST thing you will ever taste. It condensed shaved ice milk and usually with red bean and ice cream. Now there are many different types and topics. I usually like the green tea one. Yes...that is all I have to say other than it is very aesthetic and big major Korean memories. 

GO to Cafe Bene :)"
"I usually come here for brunch now, but when I came here for dinner, I came for the famous Chocolate Mousse Bomb. It was the best dessert ever!! Too bad they don't make it anymore - huge disappointment. :( Took away all reason to come for dinner.

For breakfast, the chef makes several omelets at once and they're really good. There's an option to have it made of egg whites too, which I hear is healthier. You can also ask for sunny-side up. I usually like scrambled eggs, but the last time I came here, the scrambled eggs didn't even look like eggs and there wasn't much to rave about it. The mango smoothie near the salad is fresh and tasty. The muffins and donuts are really tiny - bite size - for breakfast, but when they switch over for lunch, the muffins are much bigger! Speaking of lunch, the beef tendon with noodles is good!

This place used to be a 4 with its famous dessert, but now that it's gone, it's more of a 3 or 3.5."
"Had the fascia board, porch overhand and soffit painted by Textbook. They were great with communication and quality of work. I recommend them to anybody who needs painting done for a reasonable cost by a professional crew."
"Meh'
I've never had Mexican, thought it was an experience to behold but was let down. Only gave 3 because kids / husband liked their meals. 

The beans that you serve with some meals looks like poop and to add insult to injury it looks as though it had been put on the plate hours before the actual food was. The Chula (not sure of the spelling) was too big for one person and sadly, very bland. Husband liked his fish, kids liked their tacos. The nachos and dip at the start of the meal were nice but those little dishes you have the condiments in where difficult to scoop out of. 

Server & service was very friendly & fast."
"ordered a plant/flower arrangement from 1800flowers and for 90$ I am appalled at the arrangement that was sent to the funeral home!! the basket it came in looked like it came from the dollar store , was about 9inches in diameter and a cheap white bow on top!!! for a funeral!! I called to tell them about it , was luckily given half my 90$ back but I would've given it back for all my money back!!! as far as the plant I am going to have to repot it because a day later parts of it are already wilting!! and I'll have to put it in something that doesn't look like an Easter basket that even a kid didn't want!!!"
"WOW!! Absolutely F'in amazing pizza. I'm a neighbor to this spot and never stopped in till today!  This pizza is so damn amazing ,I wanted to call every pizza spot I've tried and ask them what the heck they've been doing this whole time ?!? This is the spot I will bring my lady, friends, family ,enemies, and in-laws to. Don't take my word for it. See for yourself. 


Save me a seat!"
So dont live here.  Went in just to get some information.  There where three men stand in the offices.  After 10 mins and no one ever say hello i walked out.  Leasing is selling.  I just want some information to come back and make an appointment to view apartment.  Guess there lost.  Wouldn't want to live in a place where they dont even talk to you.  Guess my skin color was to light.  Heres another hint maybe it was that i was a women.  I will take my money eles where a watch the bad reviews.
"Went here tonight, a Saturday. It was pretty good! Lots of women and available men. I can't say much about Calgary clubs, but this one is worth checking out. Get drunk and have some fun! Commonwealth is a decent bar. Two floors of different musical tastes, and many adventures to be had."
Fantastic place. Staff extremely friendly and hookah are delicious. Atmosphere is perfect for good times. Really enjoyed my time here and im definitely coming back.
"Huge portions, fair prices and a wrap around case of baked goods means a very happy Yelper!  After going to Weiss a few months ago, my friends said ""you need to try Bagel Cafe, it's the best Jewish deli around""!

Bagel Cafe has a very home-like feel to it and the menu is printed on a multi-page newspaper.  I went with a half-chicken salad sandwich that was still a decent size.  I kept eying my friend's large 1/2 sandwich he ordered which was loaded with meat and I don't think cost more than $15.

For dessert I went for their smaller sized cookie (the large is gigantic) but there is a whole slew of things to pick from at the entrance!!  Don't take my word for it though, billionaire Venetian owner Sheldon Adelson was at the table behind us!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"
"The NBA finals are on and you're traveling. But you're staying at the Westin Hotel, so it's all good, right? Wrong. The television here failed disastrously, making for an unpleasant experience, despite everything else about this hotel being lovely. The aspect ratio was locked in that weird stretch mode, making all the faces and bodies out of proportion, ruining the experience. And there was no way for users to adjust the settings. I called maintenance, and they could help a little, but not much. And then, the quality of their cable is terrible; really grainy picture. Moreover, for whatever reason, each input of the remote would take ages to show up on the television. I stayed at a holiday inn express the night before, and the television was crystal clear and wonderful. Very sad. I would have been much better off with rabbit ears and over the air HD."
"The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, beautifully decorated.  My wife and I arrived early and were seated before our reservation time, which was great.  

The middle-aged lady who seated us is a great public relations ambassador for the restaurant: welcoming, charming, delightful, and gracious.  She knew that I had requested a table in a quiet part of the dining room and apologized for there being no such table available.  The noise became so intense as to cause my wife and me to have to lean over the table and yell to each other to be heard.  The atmosphere was frenetic and crazed, not a good way to enjoy a costly meal.

My wife's average-size martini was a ridiculously pricey $13.  I was surprised that a full-service restaurant with a large bar offers no draft beers.

Our server was full of personality and made countless trips to the table.  His recitation of the items that are available, specials, and potential combinations, offered when he brought our beverages, was overkill, too much for any diner to absorb and more than most would want to hear.  It also gives the diner the impression that the server is doing everything he can to pad the check.

Our entrees did not arrive until one hour had elapsed from the time we ordered.  To his credit, our server let us know that the food was delayed due to a large Pittsburgh Steelers party which hobbled the kitchen.  To make it up to us, he provided a dessert of our choice on the house.  We selected a huge, dense, delicious carrot cake, enough for three or four people.

The small beet salad and ribeye steak that my wife had and my iceberg wedge salad with creamy herb dressing, bacon, egg, and red onion, and my Chef's Creation short rib meatloaf with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans were all excellent.  Te entree portions were well-sized; the side dishes were inadequate.  The warm, herbed bread and soft butter which accompanies every meal is an outstanding treat.

Teamwork is used here to deliver food to the tables.  As I expected, the young lady who brought our salads knew who got which dish without asking.  I was surprised that the necktie-clad gentleman who appeared to be a manager, placed my wife's entree in front of me and mine in front of her.

I was surprised that a top-notch restaurant like this would have the servers belt out ""Happy Birthday"" as a cupcake was brought to a guest to honor them.  It is inappropriate and heightened the already raucous atmosphere.

The restaurant provides complimentary validated self-parking in a garage which enables the diner to enter and exit without going outside, a plus in blustery weather.

The manager okayed my use of an expired discount card entitling me to $20 off the cost of two entrees.  I greatly appreciated that.

Be prepared to spend a lot of money here.  One must order judiciously to avoid a meal which, with the encouragement of servers like ours, can easily come to $100 per person.

Given the ear-splitting noise, I would not rush back here despite what was in many ways a marvelous and unique dining experience."
"I'd have to say the food is just ""average"" here. I tried the fish and chips since they looked so good on the menu. The fish was 'ok', nothing special. The breading was bland, no real seasonings or anything special. The onion rings were not good at all. The onion was still crunchy, probably undercooked since they were pretty large. The service was very good here though, prompt and friendly."
"Chain restaurant. Nothing special here. 
Got a ginger something cocktail, it was bad!
Small portions for a main meal. Cold and dark inside :/"
"With their name and such positive reviews and high ratings you would think this would be the best yum cha in Vegas....yeah it doesn't work that way on the Monday after thanksgiving with people sparsely seated. Best customer service but a lot of their baked goods like BBQ pork bun, coconut bun, baked egg yolk bun at the counter were old and just kind of reheated and a little dried out/ chewy. They ran out of steamed egg yolk buns and no longer have that egg yolk cake pictured in yelp, and didn't make several dishes that they normally would like white fungus they have on their slide show and other items I asked for. All of the steamed items from cart were gold and unappetizing, the cheung fun was ice cold and noodles hard. This is probably one of my worst dim sum experiences but I am from San Francisco....This meal was all a waste of calories and we should have stopped ordering instead of having hope. Sorry but 1 bad experience prob won't bring me back here despite the really nice helpful people that work here."
"American Girl ....What can I say? It is the most customer unfriendly store I have done business with and with employees who seem to be incompetent. In the Chicago store , it took 45 minutes to check out with only 1 person in front of me in line with an employee and manager waiting on her, and no one else to wait on anyone else, 
The day before Thanksgiving, I was on hold for 90 minutes to place an order of $400+ with a 20% discount. !/2 of the items I wanted were already on back order.
This was the last purchase I made with this credit card as it was compromised. Which brings me to my next complaint. The first restock order was tagged because my original order was with the compromised credit card. Since I would not send an email over an unsecured line with my new credit cars number, I had to call the 800 number and I was on hold for over 99 minutes. I asked to have my new credit card number put on file and was told that would happen. A week or so  later I got another note for a $24 change order that was rejected apparently, and I had to call again. Wrong credit card as they continue to use the compromised card.
Now yesterday after a 1 hour hold, the man I spoke with promised me that he had taken care of the situation and this would not happen again. This morning I received another AG email saying my credit card was rejected for the same order. I had to call again. This am I was on hold for 35 minutes only to discover the man I spoke with yesterday lied to me twice. 
Today I spoke with  a women who spoke to a supervisor who instead of responding to me sent the employee back with an unbelievably stupid message and would not assume the responsibility of leadership. I do not care if their system is new and they are working out the kinks; at least you could hire more employees to answer the phones so customers are not already frustrated doing business with such a poorly managed company. Shame on you!!!"
"Not worth the hassle.  Seating capacity says 135 inside and 30 outside. No parking. Drove around for 10minutes looking for a parking spot. Saw numerous signs for towing but no spots for Moe's. Finally found a spot. Stood in line another 10 minutes to order. $10.28 for a BBQ sand, two sides and a drink. Sandwich was the size of a slider. Expected larger portion for price. Not a good value or convienient for lunch."
"They really need an upgrade on their TV's.
The wings are good however a little pricey and it always seems too loud to hear the game.
We keep going back as there is not many other places to watch football, eat and drink when you have kids with you."
"I wish I knew what went wrong, but we must have missed out on what everyone else has been having. My family and I had looked forward to the Rio's infamous seafood buffet and were sorely disappointed.

The crab legs were absolutely nothing to write home about-- i've had better at seafood dive bars in chicago.  The crab meat was small, and sour/juicy. Not sweet and succulent  AT ALL.  Huge disappointment.

On the hunt for the lobster tails, all we found was this concocted stew-like mix of mystery seafood meat. Brownish, bland, and not very flavorful filled with shrimp, lobster tails, and i couldn't tell you what else. But the lobster tails were EXTREMELY overcooked. Chewy, inedible, and oversalted. I've never done this in my life. I felt wrong to do it. But it was so bad, I wasted 2 or 3 lobster tails.  I mean really. If you're gonna kill everything that's good in a lobster, just freakin steam it and serve it with some butter and call it a day.

Everything else there was just forgettable. Even the raw oysters were small, meager, and tasteless.

Had it not been for the buffet of buffet pass we had, i couldn't imagine dishing $40 for this place. 

The one saving grace? Gelato  for dessert. And even that wasn't that great."
I went in knowing exactly what I wanted. The sales person Rocio was really nice and attentive and she has my name which is rare and awesome. I wasn't there more than 15 minutes and I had my purchase paid for and on my way to the warehouse to put it in my truck. The warehouse guy was nice too and made sure to secure the furniture to my mom's specifications which (mexican mom's can be demanding) overall good purchase and a neat time at Living Spaces Phoenix.
"When you call all you ever get is a answering machine,so don't be surprised if you never talk to anyone.There Moro should be Precision Tune home of the excuses,when they screw up the repairs.



Tried several more times to actually talk to a person,but no luck.Don't bother leaving message as no one will ever return call.Bottom line total waste of time and money,will never return for anything.Unless something that is supposed to be under warranty again needs repair,and then will take some where else to make sure repair was handled correctly.They don't care at all about customer service,or even just doing a good job at what you're paying them to do.DON'T GO!!!!!"
"It's good, not the greatest, but good. I wish they would do a traditional country fried steak instead of the fried NY steak that they do. The last time I went I ordered the ham steak and eggs, the ham was great, not over salty and very tasty! I asked for sunny side up eggs, when I received my plate they were sunny side up but basically cooked all the way thru with hard yolks. The breakfast gravy here is better than most places in town and the cup o bread is amazing!"
"Went here to get a wall mount for our TV.  Ni one greeted us or offered assistance.  Found what we needed then stood at the check out without acknowledgement.  The associate finally addressed us and went through the motions of checking us out.  Oh, and he was eating candy.  Rude."
Great service and fast response. The tech was onsite within an hour after my inquiry. Great job!
"So before this review, I wrote about how much I loved Flict salon. Unfortunately, times have changed.

My cousin was over for a wedding and had never dyed her hair before. She liked my red ombrÃƒÂ©, so I decided to take her to Nicole, the hairstylist who did my hair. My cousin has long, curly, thick black hair. I do too, but her hair is longer, curlier, and darker than mine. When I got my hair done before, Nicole did a great job. She lightened my hair before adding the color, so that it would show up. 

This time however, she did not lighten my cousin's hair. The color, as common sense would provide, did not take to her hair. I told Nicole I didn't see any difference, but she said that we should go outside and look at it in the sunlight. That didn't really help... I still couldn't tell the difference. Nicole took my cousin back to lighten her hair. I trusted her to work wonders, like she did on my hair.

She lightened about two small strands of my cousin's hair. She put the color, and this time it took. It just looked terrible that she only had two red strands while the rest of her hair was black. My cousin has A LOT of hair... At this point we've been in the salon for 6 hours. We were told to come back the next day to make her hair look even and have an appointment with the owner. 

I forget the owner's name.. I think it was Helen. The owner would take good care of us... Right? Wrong. She finished up my cousin's hair so it looked presentable. She then continued to charge us $300! She included the fee for the botched hair job Nicole provided. I was paying for INVISIBLE hair dye! My hair cut and color had costed less than $150. It was ridiculous that we had to pay so much for the hair stylist's mistake. You'd think the owner would care more about the actual customers, and not how much money to suck out of them. It made me sad, but I vowed to never go back to Flict. Now I'm looking for a new hairstylist. Any suggestions?"
"They have some very cute, thoughtful, and inexpensive gifts.  It was definitely worth the drive!!!  Some of their items are so unique.  Service was great.  Molly was unbelievable.  When I get back I will definitely check this place out again.,"
"Welcome to Madison, Stone Creek Coffee! I remember visiting your cafes in Milwaukee many years ago. 

I stopped by on my way somewhere thanks to a neighborhood postcard for a free coffee drink.

This newly built cafe in a brand new residential building is light, airy and spacious. Since I ordered and left, I didn't stay to soak up the morning sun through the huge windows, though they do look inviting for another time. I'm looking forward to when the overhead garage door is opened in the summer. The barista was friendly and chatty as I asked about their expansion to Madison, and about the little room off to the side. It's going to be a tasting room and a barista training area. 

Lots of coffee prep gear and branded things for sale. We now have a lot to choose from on E. Washington and Williamson between 1st and the Capitol, I don't know how to choose, adding this to my list of good places to meet with a group."
Worst service... ita been 20 mins and Im still waiting for my bagel with cream cheese.. abt to leave. Not worth being late to work... No selection of bagels and its only 7am...  works are walking around slow like no one has anywhere else to be... Workers seem confused... I will never be back to this location.
"Something White was the first shop we went to in search of my sister's wedding gown. Quite honestly, we were not planning on buying a dress that day; we had planned to look at a couple different boutiques before making a decision. However, Rebecca made the experience so fun and enjoyable! My sister was able to pick out the dresses she liked to try on, but Rebecca made some suggestions based on my sister's style and helped guide us through the entire experience. Mallory, my sister, ended up choosing ten dresses to try on, which could have gotten overwhelming had Rebecca not asked us to narrow down and ""rule out"" dresses as we went! Once we had narrowed it down to two, Rebecca put Mallory's hair up, gave her earrings to try on, put a veil in her hair, etc. to give Mallory an idea of what it would look like ""day of"". Mallory was GLOWING; you could tell she truly felt like a bride! Mallory ended up finding ""the dress"" at Something White and decided to cancel her future appointments at other boutiques. We were pleasantly surprised at how easy our decision had become! I highly recommend you start here... be warned that it will set the bar pretty high. Thanks for a great experience, Rebecca!"
"This place is shit. The back of the store is absolutely unhygienic. I can't believe they are still running their business in that dirt. The management is absolutely unprofessional and the food is mediocre. The employees seem miserable and no one speaks English including the owner. I saw one of the bakers lick a spatula before putting the cream onto the cake. Please, avoid this bakery at all costs."
"If you're staying at Caesars and make a reservation on here because it's close, don't. It's literally the farthest possible restaurant from the hotel. BUT, worth it. Good service, extensive menu items, i had the surf and turf and my steak was cooked to perfection.
The location allows you to watch random crazy ass tourists stroll by. 
Worth the walk."
"Okay, I have to say that this is one of the best electronic/computer store chains out there. It's like a CostCo for techno-geeks! Okay, that's giving them too much... but it's definitely got a great selection of brands and they have the most inventory as far as I am concerned. I do have many ""areas for improvement"" though. 

For one, the Frys Electronics website tends to have very different sale prices & advertisements as opposed to the actual store advertisements which is really inconvenient! --Example: I find a great deal on the website for a motherboard and processor bundle, and the item says nothing about it being available ""online only"" or being out of stock, so I get to Fry's and... the bundled item I want is not there, nor is it even available seperately!
Another thing, now, I'm not sure about the other locations, but the one here in Vegas sure employs a lot of asian people, FILIPINOS to be exact. I am definitely not racist or anything close to it, I am actually mostly Filipino myself, but there just seems to be something odd about it. The store is huge and more than 50% of the floor staff is Filipino, and young. (I guess they feel like everyday is a black&white party, hahaha!)
Whatever.
Moving along, I'm pretty sure some of the staff, especially those in car audio, computer sales, and home video/audio, are working on commission so they try much harder than the rest to offer help & customer service. These people either:
1. know their sh!t or
2. know how to bullsh!t.
It's just a matter of you, as the customer, doing your own personal research and matching it up to what the sales associate is telling you... and you must have some sort of idea of what you want.
Then, there's the bunch of girls that stand around in the digital camera department talking to each other who don't know sh!t about the products when asked... and then there's the others that just pass you to ""someone in that department""... great, right?
The warranties for your purchases aren't the best (Best Buy actually has one of the better warranty options available, IMO)
Another thing that let me down at Fry's is that they don't sell anything Nikon...whyyyy not? Sadness, considering I own a D60 --sigh--

Now, despite my MANY pet peeves about this place, I still like Fry's, especially when there's a good sale and I know exactly what I want/need... Fry's gets a solid 3 stars from me."
"Went here for my traveling project happy hour celebration.  The food was good but typical bar food.  Pizza, chicken tenders, etc.  The food was plentiful.  The drinks were good.  I had a white wine and mixed drink - both were good and they had a nice selection for a Brewery in college town Tempe."
I have seen almost all of the Cirque du Soleil shows and this one is nothing special. Gotta love the Beatles but dont expect to see anything you havent seen before.
Terrible Buffet for 35 bucks. Pizza was old. Sides had been sitting for awhile. Dessert tables were a bit of a joke compared to other hotels. Spend the extra 5-15 bucks and go to Aria's or Ceasar's Buffet. Even Paris has an equivalent or better buffet. Overall unimpressive given that it's the MGM.
"Ordered a pizza online, never received a conformation email...after an hour and 15 minutes called and was put on hold. I hung up after 9 minutes on hold.....calling another pizza store that WANTS my business...."
"Coming here is only worth it if you go while they have their buffet open! It's run of the mill North Indian food and isn't bad but isn't wonderful either. 

I would not come here if they are not having their buffet open because the dish prices are expensive considering the quality/quantity of the food."
"Too expensive, too long waiting time and food not good enough. There are better places in CU with the same price range and better quality"
"Love this restaurant! Yum yum! Wings are bjg, and if you write a review, you will get either mini corndog, shaved ice, french fry or house sake for free. Thats why im writing it now! But seriously, highly recommend this place. Friendly service, good food and affordable price :)"
"Ok food. Minimal interaction with staff. Clean environment. I would prefer panera or subway but I had to try it. 

$11 for soup salad and tea."
"After waking up in the morning in Vegas, we decided to try to find a place to eat.  After checking out some of the restaurants, the accountant in me thought, why don't we pay few bucks more and go to an all you can eat buffet?? Before buffets in Caesar's, Wynn, etc. came in, Bellagio buffet was the place to be.  So, I thought I would relive my childhood memory and walked over to the Bellagio buffet.  There was a little bit of a line when we got there on Tuesday morning, but the line moved pretty quickly and we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  

I had thought there was going to be crab here, but unfortunately there was none. (For also the same price at the Aria buffet, you can get crab so I was disappointed by this.)  So, I tried other things,  one of the main things that I enjoyed was prime rib.  I usually do not like meat that is so rare, but this was so tender and delicious.  Dip it in the au jous sauce they have in front of the carving station and it make it so much better.  Aside from the prime rib, I did not really care for anything else.  I tried the pasta, sushi, pizza, and a few other things, which I did not think was bad but not great.  I also tried some of their dessert, which I thought tasted a little too sweet (I know, it's dessert, but I almost thought it was sugar overload).  

With all the other buffet options here, I think that the Bellagio buffet has become somewhat obsolete compared to the other newer buffets."
"This store is a disaster. Walk in and immediately find a dirty store with items scattered everywhere. 

Target has been a long time love of mine, it's such a fun story (normally!) and I spend a lot in store - or did until the whole credit card debacle. Anyway back to this store...

A guy is standing behind the registers wearing a dirty red polo shirt with tons of stains on it. 

Pick up a bunch of fun stuff in my cart. I do love Target. 

Walk to dressing room area to find it abandoned. A female employee walks over followed by a male employee named Gideon. She asks if he followed her over there and he says yes to stare at her butt (red flag #1). Gideon looks like a 16 year old Bieber. He walks behind dressing room counter to continue flirting. 

After the woman checks the number of items I have and starts talking me back he says I can't try on underwear. I let him know I will follow the policy and do so over clothing. He says its against their rules (he DOESN'T work in this part of the store). I tell him I just got some a few months ago and bathing suits are the same policy. 

He says what store was it at - not here buddy! I am thinking - what's wrong with this kid? He says its flat out not allowed so I asked him if this was a new policy and he says its always been like that. 

Not fighting with him so I leave and as I am walking out I ask for a manager to check their policy. The guy, in the dirty red polo, just stands there with a blank face for a few minutes. Says nothing. It's so strange!

During this time I noticed other people having issues and was all whatever time to leave (though normally love Target - it's my guilty pleasure!). Anyway guy decided to go awol on me and doesn't apologize or say sorry the first guy was wrong (which he was). Dirty shirt guy is only bothered that I pointed out something wrong in his store. He won't chat with me, won't share his name and just tells me to talk to his manager who isn't there. 

So some nice guys working nearby come over and say his name is David and they don't know why he is being so rude. But they were clearly sorry. Even more so when they realize I am a mom as my little guy and family walk over. 

They tell me dirty polo shirt guy is named Dave and is not very nice. After chatting with them Dave decides to make up that I used a curse word at him (?!?!) and comes over to confront me - it's really time to leave. 

I would avoid this store like the plague. As many customers pointed out its dirty, several employees are standing around doing nothing and apparently it's okay to be rude to customers, make up policies, not apologize and then make stuff up about them. What?!"
"Food and service were very good. I had the Lobster Bisque soup, which was tasty, although it could have used a bunch more lobster. The bruschetta sampler was delish though!!!"
"An enchanting fire side lounge with interesting ceiling arches and comfy leather seating - sounds like the type of place you relax with friends, right ? Well, maybe I'm getting old but if there isn't a live band or karaoke going on then the music does not need to be screaming loud. I was yelling at my friend the whole time trying to talk and really couldn't just relax and enjoy. The music selection was good but seriously, I'll take my fancy beer and conversation elsewhere."
"Tagged along with family as they dropped by here to get gingerbread cookies.  My sister apparently likes this place.

The interior of the store is quite nice (I remember the lighting being very soft and flattering).  There is quite a bit of food merchandise (pancake mix, candy, gift baskets) and, weirdly, a display nook of costume jewelry and a handbag.  They also have very large pastry case displays filled with goodies.  I do think the baked goods look ""too perfect"" and mass produced though (this was a red flag).  The cashier was pleasant.

While family members seemed to enjoy the treats, I found them lacking.  The gingerbread man (with chocolate pants, a detail family enjoyed) had a very dry texture and was somewhat ""dog biscuit-like"" (very bland and crumbly).  The peppermint brownie was HALF frosting (chocolate frosting over peppermint frosting/creme over a chocolate chip brownie), which attempted to distract from the fact that the brownie itself was on the dry side, but it didn't make up for the loss of brownie ""gooey-ness.""

I won't seek this place out again, but I would veto it for lunch either.  We really need a high-quality bakery cafe to replace the Panera-fied and bastardized Paradise Bakery."
"Bought a tandem axle trailer from this company. It kept burning though tires. I thought we had a bent axle but found out from another shop that the axles were fine, they were installed wrong at the factory. They were 1 5/8"" off in alignment. Took it back to diversified and they won't warranty it. Cheap trailers and lousy service. Find another company! I buy 4 to 5 trailers a year for our company, trust me- there are better companies and trailers out there!!"
"Great service! Very nice selection. My husband neeeded an eye exam. Instead of a chain or someplace in the mall, he made an appointment here. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. We had our two- year old with us. No one flinched when they saw a young  child. Everyone greeted him too. Our eye exams were quick and painless. No one pushed extra tests on us. No one tried to press us for other eye exam options. No one held us hostage while we waited for our prescriptions to be ready.  We were helped pick out new glasses. I say helped. Not hovered over. We choose some awesome new glasses. My husband is going to look so good in his new glasses made of wood! We will not be going back to anywhere else for glasses. The service here just can not be beat. Thank you!"
"Eat n Park.  For someplace that originally started out as a drive in - wouldn't you think it would be Park - n Eat? I digress...

So Sunday morning - breakfast. I admit, our first choice was the Denny's down the street but it was gone!  What?? So, next best thing - Eat n Park!

We timed it perfectly.  Seated right away - NICE! Just before 11:00 am when they change from the breakfast bar to the brunch bar and the place gets bombarded from the church crowd. 

Me; French Toast Smile - Sausage
Wife: Pancake Smile - Sausage

Service - eh, the lady was nice but was obviously working a lot of tables.  Strange though, there were Eat n Park employees running around everywhere! If you've never watched them switch out the buffet, they are quite efficient at it.  One minute fruit and eggs, the next, fried chicken and pasta!

The sausage, so not good that we didn't finish eating it.  Who doesn't finish their sausage!!!!! 

The eggs - perfect. Over medium, hot, nice.

Pancakes and French Toast - not hot, no flavor. very bland. 

Syrup - yuk. odd flavor and thin. 

Me: French Toast Frown - mystery meat
Wife: Pancake Frown - mystery meat

Watching the switching of the buffet from breakfast to brunch plus hot eggs cooked to order = 2 stars."
"I suppose you get what you pay for and BUDGET is right. The online reservation process was easy and convenient and I thought I was saving some money by paying ahead of time. I got to this location and noticed there was a bit of a line but was helped out rather quickly. But also noticed the customers in line were a little agitated. The check-in process was pretty quick. Brenda was very accommodating. I received my rental paper work and was told that the van would be pulled to the front of the building. So I walked out and waited.... and WAITED. Finally saw the the van get pulled and they brought it straight into the back lot.... and so I waited a bit longer .... AND WAITED some more! I walked backed and Brenda said it would be out any minute now. So I WAITED a bit longer but this time inside because it was getting warm out. And I continued to WAIT LONGER. The line seemed like it wasn't getting any shorter and the customers were talking about how this location is known for taking an extremely long time. I walk back to the counter and ask Brenda how much longer and she says they were still cleaning the van! I tried to be as polite as I could be but I thought the reason why people make reservations is so that the company would know ahead of time what vehicles they would need to have ready! Guess not! So I continue to wait for them to finish cleaning the van... and I WAIT and WAIT AND WAIT LONGER. Mind you they didn't bother to update me about why it was taking so long. I had to follow up with them! Taking about 1hr and 30mins to leave the rental place even though you have a reservation is not ok! Next time, not sure there will be a next time, let the customer know what's going on! I'm sure if the employees were in our shoes they would like to know what's going on! 

I guess I should have expected this because the last time I rented from another Budget location they didn't even have a car for me even with a reservation and they had to bring me to another location where I got a car that was extremely dirty- still had trash in it, dirt all over the floor mats, and no gas! 

Lesson learned: pay a little extra for better service and shorter wait times! 

I REALLY HOPE THE PROCESS FOR RETURNING THE VEHICLE IS A LOT SMOOTHER!"
"I haven't been to an Earl's in a long time, but the memories I have were good.  I don't remember not being satisfied and leaving hungry.  I ordered the cajun chicken burger with fries.  I am not one for huge portions by any means, but come on, this sandwich was teeny.  It equaled to about half of a normal sandwich.  Also, the cheese looked and tasted like Kraft processed cheddar.  Fries were cold and the little bowl they came in appeared to be half full.  My friend ordered the lobster linguini and it looked like it had been sitting for while.  Looked like a dried clump.  Won't be back anytime soon."
"Really dissapointed with the management this time around overseeing the show. Obviously there are certain things allowed in showroom and I have been to show at least 5x ,its really fun but Last night I walked out and was furious! A manager talked really ugly to my friend inside the showroom basically scolding her and basically made her feel very very  uncomfortable. He could of had a different demeanor and been more professional. I took him aside and gave him a peice of my mind and he wasn't the least bit concerned that we were leaving. If water,clothing,and crotches can be rubbed on the audiences face, then when a girl touches the dancer, or plays along it shouldn't be such a big deal....... I will not be going there for a while......"
My husband is allergic to onions and they put everything on his sandwich. This is like the 5th time. Horrible. I hate having to live by this location
"Went to a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised with Honey Salt.  The food was somewhat experimental but very,very good.  Not what I would expect to find 'off the strip' in Vegas.  Our lunch was punctuated with moments of really great food, but with one or two little things that were slightly off.  This is a five star kinda place and I think that I will need a reservation the next time I go.   I am looking forward to eating at Honey Salt again and seeing what else they have come up with."
"Since the first time I came to get my car washed here, service has really gone down... don't know if I'm just coming on off days, but I came in at about 8:15am on a Saturday. It seemed like they weren't open yet... yelp said they open at 7am... maybe 3 employees were working? 

I got $2 off early bird special.

At about 8:30am. Some guy walk up and they allowed him to help wash the cars... hmmmm...


Just seems like professionalism has taken a hit here at Alamo..."
"The Sugar Factory is in fact as the name implies, a place of sugar! Candy galore!! They have gelato and coffee as well. However, their stuff is pretty pricey. This specific location in front of Paris is open 24 hours while the others are not. They  also have couture candy pops, which seems like every up and coming, hip celebrity has one with their name. Celebs like the Kardashians, Britney Spears, Jersey Shore have one. There's even Hello Kitty and a Vegas themed one. Basically, they are blinged up candy holders for about $25... pretty pricey if you ask me. The refill pops are I think 3 for $12. Not sure how good those pops are as I didn't try them. The only thing I bought was a box of mints because it had my name on it. I didn't realize it was just a cheap sticker on the box and not actually embossed on until later. I would come here again to look at the stuff and possibly catch celeb sightings. One of the workers was very nice and told my friend and I about all the celebs he met while working there and  that they make appearances pretty often for signings at the Sugar Factory. As far as buying sweets, I think I will pass as it's just regular candy but overpriced. However, there is a restaurant side which I might try sometime."
"Well a new year is about to begin and I am not getting anywhere with my issues.   I got a new washer, but I am being told by the plumber that the no hot water is the washer issue and the appliance people say it is a plumbing problem, but nothing is being done.   And I went to go change the filter the first part of November and there was no filter so I notified my property manager and do you know I still do not have an air filter.   Almost 2 months later and they cannot send someone out to see what size I need.  So now I have to go buy a tape measure (no I don't need one for anything else) since they can not get the information they should have for this condo.   My next step will be to contact the owner of the Condo myself and give them copies of all the emails so they can see how their condo is being taken care of by the property management team."
"Seriously the best Asian fusion I've ever had. I got the green curry, my girl got the bento box combo. Every single thing was amazing. 

I only leave good reviews, and have only left them for a few restaurants, and this deserves 10 stars. Staff is ridiculously awesome, food is ridiculously good. Beer prices and drinks beyond reasonable, and the 4-6 happy hour has plenty of Great deals. And the whole vibe and setup is chill and modern. Love the comic book menu also. 

Just come here you won't regret it. I can't wait to try every single thing on the menu. Will update this as I keep coming back and finding more awesome things. Soooooooooo goooooodd."
"Defalco's Let me count the ways thou love ye.
1. The freshest Ingredients
2. Everything is literally  amazing (especially the chicken salad sandwich)
3. Cheesecake and all deserts are off the Chizain
4. Store even smells great
5. Italian done right 

Seriously been coming here for 12+ years. EVERYTHING is good. The wait is long because they make it fresh, so if you lack patience phone your order in. Go here NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously stop reading this and go to Freaking DEFALCO'S JABRONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh really your going to sass me now? That's it no Chicken Salad for YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Do not go here! I had an appt scheduled and after sitting there for almost 30 min (on my lunch break) I asked how much longer it would be and he said an hour! It would have been nice if he would have told me that upon arrival. So frustrated. Will not go back due to poor customer service. I was just there the day before for a pedi, so much for my repeat business. I also work on the street and will NOT suggest this place. The price is right but not the service."
"Today they were at the Foothill Hospital. Waited 40 minutes to order and 8 minutes to get my food. I ordered the BBQ Brisket,  BBQ-tine and Garlic Fries. 

BBQ Brisket bun was very soggy. The brisket is okay. I would have liked it if they toasted the bun 1st so it didn't get soggy quick and more BBQ sauce for the brisket.

BBQ-Tine was too salty and I didn't get the taste of BBQ at all. It was basically a poutine with meat on it. Where's the BBQ?

Garlic Fries-I thought the fries are sprinkled with garlic herbs by the sounds of it.
However, to my surprise they are marinated in garlic juices. I would have liked it with fresh herbs and salt.

I spent 20$. I don't think it was worth the line up and the money."
"Beware, this is the kind of place that makes you stand in line just because they can.  What should have been a 10 minute wait turned into 45 because of deliberate slow service.  

There is a single person cutting meat, who insists on putting everything back into a warmer after serving each customer.  If only they utilized their staff properly, and had multiple people preparing food (instead of standing around and managing the line)

The owner obviously thinks that forcing people to wait will make their barbecue taste better.  And based on these reviews, most people fall for it."
"Ordered a whole mojara frita was disappointed it was over cooked ,and dry.  When I received my order ot corn tortillas they were NOT homemade.  Asked the waitress and she said the lady was not able to make them.  I say the lady rolling out the dough.  Left the fish and tortillas a waste of money."
Well this is a neighborhood I grew up in over 40 years. And having a couple establishments to college community hang out is really nice. Specially ones where you can cruiser bike over. Over the past couple months I've frequented the Loco Petrone because it was close they have really good food but the service is really really not that good. So finally side to cut this place off of the circuit. Each time we've gone the service and food which took about 30 to 60 minutes. Let alone like tonight we were only wanted to patrons in the establishment at 8 PM. We ordered two chicken skewers and not chosen a took over an hour. And the other patrons who came in well after us got served full nachos and burritos. We got up and left and told the manager and staff this is on a septa bull. I won't return because the service is horrible. Also there's a rewards program that the staff and told us they didn't know how to use and in fact told us they didn't want to use it the last time we were there because it would affect their tip.
"Excellent Mexican Snacks! Our family got the Mango, Apple Tamarind and Chamoyada - fairly priced and excellent flavors.

Staff is friendly and welcoming. 

This will be one of our new go-to spots for sure."
Very basic Tim Hortons that is essentially a drive through. There is a tiny store to go inside but it's take-out only; there's nowhere to sit and no washrooms.
"Damn the pizza is good! Bring it with pepperoni and ricotta, a couple of side salads and boneless wings and I'm good. It's about once a week for delivery.

UPDATE: The food is becoming more erratic from Caliente. The wings arrived tough. Again. The broccoli puffs got you the extra star."
"Mmm...love me some Ravi Soups. This place was absolutely divine!! :)

Over the holidays, Husband and I made another trek across the border to Toronto to expand our culinary adventures in this great cosmopolitan city. Ravi Soups was on my to try list for ages, and this trip, we were finally able to make it.

From the exterior, the place is a bit hidden, but mostly because the signage is hand written in a script fashion. I love the rustic and hand written style, but if you're not careful, you can easily miss this place. However, if you miss it, just round the corner at John St. and you can loop over. Whatever you do, don't give up on trying this place!

Once we found parking, we scrambled inside to quickly seek some warmth. After perusing the menu offerings, we decided to split their curried lamb wrap ($8.99) and their corn chowder ($8.99). FYI, you place your order and pay, and then grab a seat.

The seating arrangement is a bit funky with a long communal table running a good length of the place made out of carved wood, with a 4-5 side tables and a small bar off the entrance. Husband and I love sitting at communal tables, so this was definitely a nice touch to our eating experience. There were already 7 people sitting at the communal table by the time we arrived, and they all seemed to have ordered the soup and wrap combo. Priced at $10.99, i think this is a great deal if you're looking for a smaller portion of their wraps and soups.

However, since Husband and I were hungry, we went with the regular portion which was filling, earthy, and extremely flavorful. The lamb wrap had such a fragrant taste with the cumin seeds and the yams incorporated throughout. The subtle bitter undertones of the baby spinach amplified the curry taste in the lamb. Not only was the lamb moist and tender, but it was just the right temperature (not too hot and not warm either - heaven in my mouth!). A great mint chutney with mango pineapple salsa topped off each bite.

Now the corn chowder was another story. :) The sweet flavor of the corn really balanced out the woodsy flavor of the lamb wrap. Topped with some shredded crab meat and thai basil, I had never experienced a wonderful corn chowder like this. What was awesome about it also was that some of the corn kernels were left whole in the pureed soup. The small bits throughout was really nicely thought out. Crab meat wasn't just topped but it was mixed in throughout and they were generous in the amount placed in the soup without being unbalanced.

Since it was cold outside (~20F), this place really hit the spot. Fresh ingredients, good portions, great value, relatively quick service, and friendly service, Ravi Soups is a must visit if you are into Indian-Southeast Asian inspired wraps and soups in the Toronto Downtown Core. 

Great for vegetarians, carnivores, omnivores, kids, adults! We will certainly be back!"
"Don't go here. Mexican sushi chefs is fine with me if they know what they're doing, they were rude to begin with... And their unagi sauce, fail.. Tuna poke, fail. Gyoza, fail. If you have a sushi place and fail those 3, you shouldn't be in sushi business. I don't even want to give any star."
Jajangmyun is gross. The pepper chicken with vegetable is weird. I miss bakhriyang (forgot how to spell)
"Who eats patbingsu when its -23 outside? Me! Like after many dinners, I was in need of something sweet. I debated going to a dessert place along Yonge, but decided to check out places along Steele. This small shoppe is located in a fairly busy restaurant filled plaza. It has limited seating, as most of their business is takeout of those cute fish shaped goodies. I almost ordered one, until I saw patbingsu on the chalkboard menu! Had to order it! It's about $10 and worth the price. A mountain of shaved ice, topped with red bean, vanilla ice cream, condensed milk, and fresh fruit. The lady who owns/runs the place is really sweet too. She giggled when she saw my boyfriend and I destroying it. Now I know where to go when I miss Korea and want that deliciously refreshing dessert."

Expensive- but most restaurants in Las Vegas are. Nothing special about this buffet aside from the all you can drink special for 15.99 with the purchase of adult dinner buffet.
All I wanted was fluffy pancakes. The pancakes were cold and hard. The sunset omelette was warm and looked like it could've been spectacular if you to been prepared properly. The potatoes were cold and not very crisp. The coffee was bad. The service was slow. Pretty much the worst meal I've had dining out in Toronto.
"Fun, nostalgic game room.  Fair prices to play video games from your childhood. I give them credit for keeping those games alive. Gosh, I'm still really good at Dig Dug!"
"Excellente variÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© de produits asiatiques, de produits et de denrÃƒÂ©es biologiques et aussi de chocolats. Bons sandwichs quoique chers. Petits plats prÃƒÂ©parÃƒÂ©s, dont des sushis et autres plats vÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©tariens tout de mÃƒÂªme sains et savoureux (bonnes alternatives santÃƒÂ© au fast food huileux). L'endroit est trÃƒÂ¨s propre. Toutefois, je suis dÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ§ue quand on emballe d'insipides fraises de la Californie et qu'on me les vende comme ÃƒÂ©tant du QuÃƒÂ©bec."
"Big money because it's in the MGM, on the strip.  Otherwise, fine pizza, beer.  Just nothing I'd seek out, or go to if it were local for me.   The big perk is it is quiet for the casino seen."
"This review is about the food. The waitress was extremely nice, the manager checks up on costumers. In fact i wouod consider coming back ONLY for their staff and their manners.

The food however is another story. It was great food it really was if you're not health conscious. I ordered the huevos rancheros. They had bacon, cheese, MORE bacon, and on top of that sour cream. I asked for none of that but ended up with about a cup of sour cream on them. I'm Mexican and never in my life have I eaten such unhealthy and bad food. Now I feel sick and nauseous. I didn't even finish the food. I only ate half of it. I could tell the beans and the salsa came from a can. It just isn't a place where a health conscious person can find anything to eat.

On the plus side? The hashbrowns were pretty good and the eggs were cooked well. Over all I would've given this place 5 stars if the food wasn't so cheaply made but to each his own. If you enjoy those types of breakfast dishes then try this place because the staff is certainly good."
"This is a Palo Alto wannabe!  It is clean, and the food is consistent for breakfast, but very uninspired.  I would say it is probably the best full service diner, I had been to in Tempe, AZ during my Sandy extended layover.  When I do return to the Tempe, AZ area it is probably one place that I may return to."
"Tried this place after watching a rerun of diners drive-ins & dives. The order process was overwhelming but the guy behind the counter helped us out. The food was good, but nothing to rave about."
"Nice atmosphere. Nice staff. They have a grill which I think makes the food taste great. This is not my favorite Italian restaurant, but it's much better than Olive Garden."
"Best barber shop I've ever been to, hands down.  So glad I had them help me with my new style.  They cut my hair like I'm their top customer, them straight razor, hot towel and massage?  I kinda don't want anyone else to discover this place."
"I used to come here a lot a few years ago when it first opened up, so I thought it'd be a great idea to come again because their salads were so good! However when I ordered the mixed greens salad to-go, it took 20 minutes for a simple salad to come out. They also forgot to give me the salad dressing. Slow and sloppy service."
great brunch. everything made to order. 16 different and super tasty items. come hungry!
"Good old fashioned fun in Vegas is possible.  
10,000 square feet of pure pinball!

Most of the games range from the 50's to 90's.  Older games are 25 cents and newer ones are 50 cents each play.  There are windows and a clock which are missing from most casinos.  There's lots of parking or you can easily take a taxi here from the strip.  This place is no frills, it's all about the games.  They have big fans and leave the doors open on hot days, no AC so you have to sweat for your pinball fun :)  It's open 11-11 every day.

They are not for profit so support this Vegas Gem!"
"First time here. Used the yelp deal. No problem redeeming it. When we got there, they couldn't find the email we sent all our paper work, but it was no big deal. We had all the shots and whatnot ready to show them. Another lady came out to take the dogs to the back. While we waited, we saw them on the backyard webcam. The whole check in took 10 - 15 minutes. Before we left, I asked if we could go see them. She said no for insurance purposes. A lady got bit by a dog. WTF. Ok, I would've like to know that first, but eh. No big deal. 

20 minutes later, I thought that she wasn't very specific. I wondered where they might be sleeping. Called and asked and they sleep indoors. Good thing because it was crazy hot. 

During their stay, the outdoor webcam did not work. We called and they said the server went out and it should be fixed by the next day. It was not, but the indoor ones did work, so I'd check every-so-often to see if the pups were there. The webcams don't have the best qualities. I wish it were more clear. 

The check out was quick. Nothing to sign. Got a free reusable bag. I saw the paper for iPhone/Android user webcam access and the outdoor webcam password changed. I was kinda pissed, they could've sent an email or something to notify all the customers with their dogs there. 

It was a good deal for 2 days."
"Ahh step back in time a bit to the way the Peppermill Coffee Shop in Reno, NV used to be and other Peppermill restaurants (al la Santa Clara, CA) that have long since disappeared used to be. 
They still have the multi-colored sugar on the tables! This was one of the most memorable touches that I recalled from Peppermill form years back and was happy to see it still alive at the Peppermill VEGA$.
IF you hunger and looking for bold and hearty portions, this is the place for you! I ordered the Red Pepper Pasta - whoo... spicy hot and so flavorful! I couldn't even finish it, it was so much. Prices were a bit steep, but considering you can easily get two meals from one portion, I say great deal. 
Service was good, nothing exceptional in fact it did take some time for our servicer to greet us at the table but once she did, it was good thereafter. I think because the Friday night we went they were extremely busy, the staff were all buzzing around like bees, even the cocktail waitresses in their evening gowns ;-)"
Solid burgers and fries. A bit pricey but not too bad when compared to a major fast food burger chain. Limited options on their menu so they can focus on what they do best.
"After visiting the Spin location in Etobicoke the week prior, and absolutely adoring it, I was super excited to check out the Vaughan location. I came late one Saturday night with a group of friends and the place was PACKED, the wait was over an hour so we hung our heads and drove over to Dairy Queen and nommed on some cheapie blizzards instead.

I came back shortly thereafter on the Monday of the Victoria Day long weekend and there was tons of space. We excitedly ordered the Fondue for Two, a smoothie, and a shake.

Our drinks came after a small wait.

Strawberry Banana Smoothie - Good! Not the best smoothie I've ever had, but still a tasty treat.
Frozen White Hot Chocolate - Is that a bit of an oxymoron, ""frozen hot chocolate?"" :) Regardless, it was hella tasty. Refreshing, and totally satisfies your sweet craving. 
Fondue for two - I was soooo excited for this because I adore fondue. After a bit of a lengthy wait, I was sorely disappointed when this arrived at our table.  The chocolate fondue sauce was COLD. Like, not even a little warmed up. It came with a little tea candle that would in no way ever make the fondue warm. It was pretty sad looking. Also, the fondue is supposed to come with strawberries and cheesecake for dipping, but instead of cheesecake we received waffle cone pieces. They didn't even tell us that they were out of cheesecake until we asked why we received waffle cone pieces (which, really, were not that great.) When we asked to send it back the girl made a bit of a fuss because ""it was already made."" She eventually checked with the manager who okayed it.

Overall, a pretty disappointing experience. Service was definitely absent and lackluster. I think I'll be sticking to the Queensway location!"
"My A/C went out at the end of April. I searched Yelp for a heating/cooling contractor in April. There were numerous companies within 20 miles of my house but what initially caught my eye about the Dukes of Air was the fact that they had over 100 (5 star) reviews on here. That was far an away more reviews than any other contractor. I decided to give them a call. They sent a tech out to take a look and give an estimate. Robert came out and he was very friendly and very knowledgable. I was pretty sure going into this that I was probably gonna have to get a new system so I was prepared for that. Robert did say that the control board was shot and he could fixit but it was just delaying the inevitable so I asked for my options on a new system. He laid it out for me and I chose a mid level (16 seer) system. Before he left he got me up into the attic and pointed out some issues with how the original system was installed and explained why and how they would install the new system to make it work more efficiently.  When it came time to schedule the install, he said it would be two weeks before the install could happen. I was nervous because it was starting to get hot out. He said he knew it wasn't ideal but when he left he promised to return within the hour for some portable units that I could use till the install happened. True to his word, he returned home I about 30 minutes with two LG portable AC units, one for each floor. It wasn't an ideal situation but it made the two weeks bearable. 

A little bit more than two months later and I am loving my new a/c unit. It keeps the house cool and it runs for significantly less time than the old unit which was on constantly.  I'm also really digging the Wifi thermostat. 

Looking for an AC contractor? These guys are great. They are honest and they take great pride in their work. I will be using them in the future. Oh yeah, their work trucks look like the ""General Lee."" What more could you want?"
"The food was amazing and the service was great. The only negative aspect of my dining experience, the warm temperature inside the restaurant. But that won't stop me from visiting again."
"Used to be a great theater but has gone downhill in recent years. Staff is downright rude to customers and the tech in the theater is old and outdated. Their UPC scanners are apparently from 1995 and are totally unable to scan a phone's screen (unlike every other Cineplex location I have been to in recent memory) even with brightness turned all the way up and Night Mode turned OFF (so that the whites are properly white).

I remember when this place opened in the 1999, we thought it was so cool and it was the best theatre in the area even worth driving to from North York right near Yorkdale (where they had also just opened a brand new, high tech theater to replace the mall's old one). But now it has just gone completely downhill. Now, you have terrible attitude from rude staff, turning lights on in the theaters before movies actually end, not bothering to install lights that actually brighten slowly as opposed to popping on at full brightness, and more. 

The theater in general is dirty & badly taken care of. This is the kind of place that makes me happy I don't need to sit on anything or touch anything that isn't my body or my clothes when I go into a bathroom (the sinks being the only exception if I don't have hand sanitizer with me).

This theater still is 1 of the only 3 cinemas in all of Ontario (and for hours of driving beyond) that you can go see a 70mm IMAX movie in full resolution & as a ""real & full"" IMAX experience so that's one of the only reasons I would still ever go to this theater and that's the sole excuse for my giving them a 2nd star in this review as opposed to just a 1/5.

So yeah, avoid this place unless you have almost no other choice OR they 1) make some serious changes in how their theater is run, 2) upgrade the hardware they're using, and 3) get an electrician who actually knows how to install lights properly to reinstall their theater lighting system. 

NOTE: I know I spelled theater differently in this review. I wanted to ensure that both Canadian and American spellings would populate search terms ;)"
"I love champagne, but it's not always the most economical choice drink-wise. That's why Narcisse Champagne Lounge's Sunday brunch is a pretty amazing deal, since it includes unlimited champagne for only $10 on Sunday's from 9 a.m.-6 p.m.

When my friends and I came in at around 10:30 a.m., we were the only people in the bar and restaurant, which was surprising to me. We sipped champagne for about an hour and a half out on the patio before moving inside (the spot isn't getting misters on the patio until this winter), and then we ordered brunch. The brunch menu had a ton of options, ranging between $6-$14-very reasonable prices considering the chic atmosphere! If you're into omelettes, you're in luck-there were a lot of choices, as well as fare such as granola, sandwiches and breakfast burritos.

I had the French toast ($10), which was different from any other kind I've had.

It was a big brioche roll stuffed with a strawberry mascarpone filling, paired with some pieces of fruit. I thought the roll was too hard, and it didn't have a buttery taste built-in like I would have preferred. It had a nice presentation, though, and my friends' food also looked great. 

Though Narcisse wasn't as hopping as I had hoped (by noon, more people had filled the restaurant, though), the space was airy and relaxing and a very pretty place to brunch at. I love the glass bubbles that hang from the ceiling, I love all the natural light that shines through, and I love the big booths that give the restaurant a Vegas feel. And you cannot beat unlimited champagne for $10!"
"This was a staple when I was a student at Case. I can still taste it! Their white pizza is the one that I compare all white pizzas to. The best white pizza is with artichokes, tomatoes and garlic."
"I had really hoped this place would be better since the location was great (right in the middle of Old Scottsdale) and the inside looked nice, but that was about as far as it went. Although our waitress was nice, the service took FOREVER, and the place was not even full at lunch time. $10 for a regular margarita at lunch time seemed a little pricey to me too. We split the 3 taco plate and had a fish taco, lobster taco and carne asada taco. Both the fish and lobster tacos were fried, not lightly fried, but heavily battered and greasy. The carne asada did not have a lot of flavor. Probably OK to go here in a pinch, but there are probably hundreds of places better than this!"
"We stay at sunset station hotel, the hotel is very clean, the room is clean, but their is no safe box in the room, and when we went to the pool they didn't have enough chairs. All the chairs were taken. Unfortunately I will not stay here again.(first time and last)."
"Good donuts, but the worst service ever! Every time I go there which is a lot since I live down the street, they ALWAYS mess up my order either i was missing an item (and still payed for it) or they make me pay more money then I should. Last time my girlfriend and I went there to eat they charged us $24 for 2 breakfast sandwiches that cost maybe $4 each, I had to literally scream at the manager to get a refund (paid with card) and it wasn't even in full they only gave me $8 cash and free food then had the nerve to say never come back again. I will never give my money or support to this establishment again"
"A small resort for a weekend get away.  The rooms comes with a full size kitchen, half size frig, and a small stacked washer drier.  It's a lovely little place to spend a quiet time away.  The pools are large with a hideaway jacuzzi area to relax it.  DVD rentals in the front for entertainment and room service from their on-site restaurant.  (You can order into the room after hours if the restaurant is closed.)  There's free wi-fi if you want to bring your computer for things.  Parking was kind of a issue since the spaces were small and the lot was very full despite it being off-season.  Friendly staff and quiet please made for a nice relaxing weekend retreat.  There's a steep $35 cleaning fee that is charged at the end so take it into account when you're budging."
"ATTENTION! NEVER USE THIS COMPANY! 

This is my first post ever, and I've been using yelp for years now. Quick story, I made an appointment at 8am. My car needed to be picked up to go to the dealership at 11am. First off, they quote me 13 miles, when Google maps says it's 9 miles away. Ok fine, whatever. But now is when it gets f uped: it's been 2 hours and they ain't here! There only explanation is he had to fuel up, and traffic. Are you kidding me? 2 hours is more than enough time for that. All I ask later is for the dispatcher to call the driver and let me know a real estimated time, and she hasn't called back for even that. This place shouldn't even be operating for real, horrible. I lost a whole day of work because of them."
"I never had such a terrible experience with the office on Highland and 51st Ave. attempting to see a doctor for a second opinion.  I was turned away twice at the 51st Ave. office because of insurance problems even after I was told the doctors were covered. The staff was so rude. I was turned away on a Monday and the same week on Thursday. Manager calls sets me up for Friday to see a doctor. On Highland. I finally saw the doctor he refers me to another doctor in the clinic. I am assured by the manager who has taken my case by the hand that she would tell me when the doctor would be covered by my insurance. No word for one month. Left hanging. I called yesterday-- one month later. I am in need of a second opinion. She now tells me he won't be covered and for four more months. I was very annoyed that she did not inform me rather than having to call her back.  Knowing that this was the case, I could've found another doctor. Their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. I would suggest, you find another podiatrist that is just as experienced, unless you want to deal with the office staff misinformation rhetoric and bad attitudes. Three strikes and you're out."
"We have used this rental company on three prior visits to Las Vegas and had a good experience.  However, something has gone very wrong with this company.  Slow check-in and when we got to the car area the counter person was not helpful at all and had the personality of a rock.  The car had not been cleaned from the prior rental customer (car was not washed and the windows we're dirty.  Since it was going to ran the next day and I knew I would not get any help from the Rock, we went on our way.  At check-in we we're told if we let them refill the car it would be less than the local station.  We used about half a tank driving around the Vegas area and got lost going back.  When we returned we we're late for our flight and when I returned the car the person said the gas was $64.00!!!!  $7.25 per gallon, it was $3.19 at the local station!! When I brought this up to the EZ guy helping use check in he said I would have to talk to the Manager and they we're around???  Since we we're late for our flight we had to go and could not wait to find the Manager.  I was asked by the company to rate their their service in an e-mail I received the next day and have not had a response yet!

Just lost a long time customer!"
"I live in the neighbourhood and was excited to see the place open after months of renovations.  Finally, the Big Reveal!  I wasn't disappointed.  I checked out the upstairs bar on my first visit and it's fabulous!   The lovely decor and fantastic views helped ameliorate the fact that the service was slow.   

I went back a few weeks later, with my guy, to check out the lunch menu at the bar downstairs, hoping they'd fixed the service issue. Nope.  While the food was tasty, service was - again - slow and our waitress seemed bored and preoccupied, despite our friendliness.  

We went back one last time (on a Monday) because nothing else in the area was open and I thought why not give it another shot.   I went in and let the staff person who greeted me know that I was there for lunch and that my date would follow shortly.   He asked me to wait at one of the side sofas until a table became available.   I saw two empty tables waiting to be cleared and assumed I was waiting for one of those.  No problem.  

Within a couple of minutes my date joined me.  A few minutes after that, two women came in, asked for a table for two and were promptly seated by the same staffer who asked me to wait.  I looked to see if he was coming back to seat us, as well but, nope.  It seemed within the space of five minutes he'd forgotten we were there.  So we left and proceeded to Boxcar Social for a light, pleasant meal.  

I won't be back and that's so unfortunate.  I love how Streetcar Developments has lovingly and painstakingly transformed the old Jilly's into an historic gem.  However, there are so many awesome restaurants to choose from in the area (Skin and Bones, I'll Be Seeing You, Ruby Watchco etc) with great food and far better service."
"I'm not going to proclaim myself a ""shopper"" by any means... Mostly because I just go to the store, get what I need, and go home the majority of the time.  Charlotte Premium Outlets really doesn't allow me to do this, but I won't fault it.  It is still ""finding its legs"" as evidenced by the empty food spaces in the food court, but things are shaping up.

It's nice to have outlet shopping on the other end of town (instead of just driving up to Concord).  The layout is very similar to any other outlet place you would find closer to the coast, and it's outdoor.

My biggest gripe is the parking lot and the entrance.  Coming off of 485, you can see the Outlets but the exit makes it feel like you momentarily get lost since it routes you away from and then back over 485- also having to go through another shopping center's roundabout.

I can definitely see this place as a good family outing.  You can divide an conquer or stick together.  It's not too too big so you can easily find each other, but unlike Concord Mills, there aren't any easily discernible ""neighborhoods"" so you end up using the stores as landmarks.

Overall I can't tell if it's a great mall since it's mostly just clothing stores for now... Usually a great one has a good mix of everything."
"All you can eat pizza is probably the worst thing they could have possibly done. Just another way to fatten up the Toronto population. Have you ever seen the people that come in here to eat the all you can eat pizza? Jeez. You'd think that if you need to walk sideways through a door, you probably shouldn't be eating pizza. 

Now that being said, I do like the all you can eat pizza and I do indulge in it every now and then. (probably once or twice a year because they only do this during the week days). No, I do not need to walk sideways through the door. I actually am 150 lb of pure rock hard muscle.

Regardless, I still like to eat here for lunch just for the all you can eat pizza. But onto the reviews, the pizza is decent. I never really fell in love with the pizza at Pizza Hut. The dough that they use just doesn't appeal to me and it kind of seems like they leave the pizza in the oven a little longer to burn the dough a little more. There is also a ton of grease on the pizza too which is not very healthy. The only saving grace is that they do serve salads. However, if you are craving pizza and lots of it, Pizza Hut isn't bad. Do not try the pasta's. They are terrible. Whoever decided to start selling cheap disgusting pasta's at a Pizza restaurant should be shot."
"The Skinny: the food tries too hard (3) service: it's good service but their menu again are deceptive with their unclear pricing structure (3) Value: for the quality of the food they serve, it's really overpriced (2).

I don't know why the hubs keeps wanting to come back here. In my head, Honey Salt is trying too hard to modernize/upgrade modern comfort food classics -- when there isn't much wrong with the the original in the first place. Sigh. Okay. Moving on.'

We've come back twice since our first visit.

We came for dinner once and lunch more recently. Dinner was a vast improvement compared to the horrible brunch last visit (see previous review) so we decided to hit it up during Restaurant week for lunch this week.

Going to this joint during lunch is pretty much another episode of the ""Housewives of Summerlin"". I swear one table of two probably had enough ""cosmetic enhancements"" that is worth more than a house. Yup - this is the atmosphere here.

We noticed though that they had this power lunch deal - $20 for a sandwich, soup/salad, fries and a choice of two desserts. My hubs reviewed their power lunch deal and was like great! That includes their Wagyu beef burger and he wanted to give it a shot. As it was listed under the sandwiches, you would assume that you'd pay the same power lunch price. BUYER BEWARE: 3 dollar surcharge on their burger option.  Which is bulls^&t because no where on the menu does it say that they charge $3 extra for the burger.

Whatever. On to the food.

I got the Caesar salad with kale, their version of a Cuban and fries with a raspberry sorbet. The Caesar was decidedly okay - it wasn't anything special - the dressing didn't have enough garlic/lemon punch to it. I also like a good anchovy kick and it just wasn't there. The Cubano was definitely lukewarm borderline cold. The thin layer of what looked like italian ham didn't offer enough salty porky goodness to offset the dry/flavorless roasted pork. There wasn't enough mustard, it definitely needed mayo and more pickles. The cheese wasn't really melted on to the sandwich either to get the gooey factor. Overall - a pass for me. The fries were okay - pretty much your standard fries from anywhere.

The hubby's hamburger was okay as far as he was able to say but the patty was definitely underseasoned.

The bread pudding was good. Nice caramelization and not overly sweet. The raspberry sorbet was nothing special though and I probably wouldn't recommend getting it again.

Overall, I think their food deserves a 3. Considering the prices they charge for the okay cuisine, this place is over priced by a long shot. Plus, the deceptive prices they have on their menu makes this place a 2 starred review. I really don't feel the need to go back here."
"One of our top spots in Akron. They will remember your name, and your drink of choice. A true neighborhood bar that pushes for top notch customer satisfaction."
The Pho was great and the soup had a great flavor. Spring rolls are awesome. Recommend to everyone
"Stopped in on a recommendation of a friend/family member. Nice building and nice ambiance. Good was in par with what we expected. Nothing special but we didn't come for anything other than an what I guess you would call and American Breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes and hash browns. Small drink cups which is fine if the server is on top of it. We liked it"
"This was such a fun environment and the food was delicious. We went for  my brothers graduation and my masters graduation. Loved the music, the games, and I loved that it was family friendly. The only suggestion I have to this place is more attentive service. It took a minute to get our drinks refilled, I understand it is busy, but don't leave me hanging! I love that there were games my nephews could play and o could enjoy. When I come to Gilbert again, I will come back for sure."
"I purchased tires and the protection plan for my car. I picked up a nail and asked Big O to patch my tire since it was so close to the sidewalk. 45 min later I was on my way. Then a couple hours later, my tire was flat again. I took it back to Big O to find they incorrectly plugged my tire. I was not happy so I left my car for them to fix. 2.5 hours later before they closed, I arrived to pick up my car to discover they didn't have time to fix their mistake and patch my tire. What a bunch of crap. I paid for this service and they were too busy. I won't buy tires here again. Customer service sucks."
"This is a Tale of Two Sushi Restaurants - one serving fresh reasonably priced sushi lunch specials mid day, and one serving fresh but grossly overpriced and undersized items at dinner. The problem is....it's the same place. 
I've eaten lunch here probably 10 times over the last few years and was well pleased with the selection, price, portion size, and service. So when I was in the area overnight last night I decided to go here for dinner, and it was like being in an episode of 'Honey, I shrunk the sushi'. I couldn't believe how small the nigiri and rolls became after 5pm. The pricing for 4 single pieces of nigiri and one small roll came to $30. This isn't LA folks, it's Olmsted OH - my expense account can't take this. 
Moral of this tale - come here for lunch and find someplace else for dinner. 
Normally a review like this would merit 2 stars, but I've given it 3 because everything I've ever had here is fresh the the service is consistently prompt and friendly."
"I've been here a few times for catch up sessions with my friends and a few times with my family. I don't bring my parents to a lot of non asian restaurants because my mom is extremely picky, but this place she's been to twice (HUGE DEAL)

Every time the service has been great, and especially great on December 23rd (fully booked and reserved at lunch time) they were helpful and eventually managed to squeeze us in. The service was great, as was the roasted red pepper soup. 

I have tried:
Korean Beef Tacos (Meh, the slaw is a little bland)
wings (only 2 flavors) are very tasty and good sizes
two different soups and both were very chunky and delicious 
their burgers were also very good
the truffle fries were meh, no real flavor so it just tastes like oily fries

It's a bit expensive for lunch but for dinner it is a great place to stop by. They also have a good wine, beer and dessert selection!

Make sure you make a reservation, even for a week day :)"
"Not a fan of the Asian flavors in burgers so I've only got the chicken katsu here. It is seriously one of the best crispy chicken sandwiches you can have.
The crack sauce and katsu sauce add so much flavor and the chicken is cooked perfectly every time.
The jazz fries are delicious as well. They're the only ones I order.
Service is always great. I love that you leave a nickname with your order. Environment is also awesome. Board games and nice urban art. Always good for a late night craving too!"
"We took a small group here last night to check out the newest Comedy Zone venue in Charlotte.  We have been regulars and long time fans of the Lake Norman Comedy Zone above the Galway Hooker in Huntersville, and this place looks to be owned by the same group as I saw some familiar faces around the house running things.

Located in the basement of the Saloon bar at the NC Music Factory, the new layout is very nice.  Seating is separated into an upper area and lower area, but not an extreme difference in the two maybe 4 steps, just enough to clear the heads of the lower level viewers.  All seats provide a pretty clear view of the stage.

We came to see Grandma Lee, but I actually got free tickets through their facebook site so make sure to LIKE them for constant promotions and giveaways. I had a feeling she was going to be more a novelty of her age, than an actual comedian, and unfortunately I was right.  Luckily, they must have known this, because they gave the first two opening comics a long time for their material, and it made it worth coming down to the show because they had the house laughing and were both very funny comedians.

Our server Cristina was amazing, and I think she stopped at our table about 20 times just to check on us despite having a pretty full house. Drinks are about $3.50 for domestic, $5-6 for imports, We had a couple sandwiches/burgers off the menu and they were both pretty good, they even have sweet potato fries.

Overall, this was a just a dry run for us to check out the new venue, but it is a much nicer location than any we have seen so far in Charlotte.  We already have tickets to see John Witherspoon from ""Friday"", Steve-O from ""Jackass"", and we heard them announce the Wayan Bros might be on the schedule soon.

We will definitely be back as I know the owners are working hard to finally bring a central hub for comedy to Charlotte.  I hope everyone starts to come out and support them so the acts can continue to become larger. Overall it was a pretty fun night, and we are looking forward to the upcoming celebrity performances they already have on the schedule."
"As much as i want to love and adore this place, I would say it's a step above mediocre in terms of their beer selection and their food. 

I love the way this bar is decorated. The ceiling is painted really colorful and there is even a bike hanging from the ceiling as well... Pretty awesome. 
Both times that I have eaten here I've sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly both times as well. The first time I came I ordered boulders mojo risen IPA... Delicious. The second time I came here I ordered a Great Lakes pilsner. I have to say their craft beer selection can be improved... Both times that I have gone there have been about three beers offered that were something I might be interested in.. And overall they only have about 8 or so beers on tap at all times. Not the selection I hope for in a bar. 

I really like the fact that this place offers so many vegan and vegetarian options. The first time I came I ordered the dirty Bella tacos with marinated portabella mushrooms and slaw- messy but delicious. The meal also came with corn and beans. 

The second time I came it was taco Tuesday! $1 chicken or beef tacos and $2 shrimp or portabella tacos. I ordered one chicken, two mushroom and one beef. I received one chicken, two mushroom and one shrimp.. I didn't complain though- I kind of wanted to try the shrimp taco anyway. They were pretty good. The chicken was a little cold and the shrimp was nothing more than small fried shrimp... The mushroom tacos are by far my favorite.. They put salsas and guacamole on their tacos as well. 

Overall, it's an awesome bar- just nothing too special or out of this world. I definitely will return for more portabella tacos on taco Tuesday though!"
Gave it a second try. Food was a lot better and service was excellent again. Rachel was great! Thanks for having us back!
"I feel like C'est Bon has been around forever and yet I'd somehow never tried it before. We were looking to order some Chinese food for dinner one cold November night and I figured the time was right to finally give this place a shot.

Big mistake.

We ordered three items:

Home-Made Egg Roll: This basically tasted like a frozen egg roll you'd buy at the supermarket. There were no distinct flavors or textures contained within, and the filling all came out on the first bite. Some kind of sauce might've helped but all that was provided were a few generic packets of plum sauce.

We moved onto the mains hoping for an improvement. No dice.

Sweet and Sour Breaded with Fresh Pineapple: This was dominated by the garden-variety and very familiar sweet-and-sour taste one associates with sweet and sour chicken balls. It's as though they took a whole jar of that sickly-sweet concoction and dumped it into a bowl of breaded chicken. It was pretty nasty, actually. Making matters worse, the chicken was completely soggy from swimming in that sauce.

C'est Bon Spicy Chicken (""One of our own creations and one of our best sellers""): If this is one of their best sellers, I'd hate to see what does poorly on their menu. This really had virtually no flavor whatsoever, and it goes without saying that not a hint of spice was to be found. The chicken was mushy and the veggies were forgettable. What on earth would possess any restaurant to serve a dish this terrible?

So yeah, needless to say we shan't be ordering from C'est Bon again."
"Im a frequent slut in L.A. So I was super excited for it to finally be coming to Vegas. Its located on the second floor of the Cosmo next to holstiens ans across of marquee. The line is super long and wraps around so be ready to wait a while. 

I typically order the slut which comes in a glass jar with a potato puree, chives n salt. $10 with 3 slices of baguettes. My slut must have been made by a mad person cuz it was hella salty!!! (see what I did there Lol)

The reason I gave 3 stars is cuz they really need to hire a cleaner. People are nasty and I get tourists are lazy and on vaca but its a mess. They have counter seating and its all sticky n gross. There's jars all over cuz people don't know if they should return it or throw it away so they just leave em."
"I came here in a group of 5 on a Thursday around 6:30pm, and we were seated right away. Happy Hour was until 7pm, so we were able to get $5 margaritas, which were delicious and much bigger than I was expecting!

They do not bring out complimentary chips and salsa; instead, they brought out some kind of puffed chip in the shape of a ring with hot sauce. The puffed chips were pretty tasteless, but I didn't mind, since I normally gorge myself on chips and salsa and am full by the time the meal comes.

We also ordered the Table Side Guacamole, which was fun to watch them make and pretty spicy! I ordered the Cheese Enchiladas Rancheras (with rice and beans), which were really tasty. The portion size was huge, so I was able to take some home.

Service was a little slow, but the food came out very quickly. Overall, a good place to get delicious Mexican food in large portions."
Haven't been in but have had the food and it's awesome! The Burgers kill! Dope onion rings!
So happy with the beautiful flowers that Lowe's provided for my daughter's wedding! Would use them again in a heartbeat.
"I'm picky. Too picky. And Victoria's photos are my favorite.  She has taken the most creative and fun shots of my family. And when it came time for my business headshot, I chose Victoria. She brings her own personal zest and fun ideas, while being totally open to brainstorm.  She is creative, patient, fun and very easy to work with. Victoria has a true gift -- she has the ability to bring out the beauty and light in the most unexpected and unique spaces.  Her photos are works of art - I'm blown away every time I look at her shots. She is incredibly skilled and wonderful to work with. I need to schedule another shoot soon!"
"Decent food but nothing spectacular. We made a log journey to get here and both my wife and I said while good, it wasn't worth the long trip.

The Margarita was very small and was gone in a couple sips. Could not taste any alcohol at all.

One item of note...I had tacos and the shells looked like boxed shells. I was expecting some fresh fried shells on the crunchy tacos but no such luck.

Good place to eat if you're in the area but definitely don't go out of your way to find this place."
"I want to like this place BUT...when I go in the women that work there have never addressed me when Im there, ever. They will speak to and greet others around so Im not sure as to what their issue is lol. The furniture LOOKS really nice but is made like crap. I was looking for a media console or cabinet but for $2,000+ I expect to see dove tail joints, doors that alighn and drawers that you dont have to pull so hard it almost pulls it over to get them to open. As I was inspecting each piece it was all made in China. For me, if Im going to drop $2000 on a piece of furniture then I will choose quality over style. And Im not too keen on being judged just because I like to shop in sweatpants a tee and a messy bun, doesnt mean I dont have money lol"
"Unique, fun, funky, tasty, divey.  Chino Bandido is a bizarro mix of chinese and mexican.  Order up front (their way or the highway).  Big portions served in tin-foil to-go containers.  Mostly clean seating area with big community tables and some smaller 2/4/6-tops.  Love the Jade Red Chicken -- sweet and spicy.  Whatever you order, make sure to get the black beans (and rice) as a side; they taste like nothing else.  Snickerdoodle cookie (great) comes with every entree, or a mudslide cookie (awesome) on the weekends.  Only downside is sketch service -- try to avoid dinner rush, where you may wait in line for 15-30 minutes to order and 30 minutes or more for your food to arrive."
"Most people judge the place but tacos are always delicious and deserves better reviews. 
The staff are very nice here and it's very clean."
"Tom's Thumb has become our favorite for breakfast, lunch, & dinner! Great coffee bar, quality food, and superior service! Exceeds expectations! Friendly staff...this is one restaurant that is an asset to the community. BTW, we patronize the full-service automotive services, too:)"
"Oh how I have missed Wahoo's!  This location did a great job curbing my Wahoo's craving.

The outer reef burrito was fantastic as always.  The guac was a littlw lacking especially when you pay more but it was still delicious.  I wish I was closer to a Wahoo's but maybe that is what makes it taste so good.

One burrito is extremely filling but sooooo good.  I have never had a bad experience at a Wahoo's and look forward to the next visit."
"We are a step or two above subway here!  The bread is much better, and there is more of the meat in their sandwichs.  I had the ""vito"", italian meat sub, with lettuce, onion, mater, dressing and mayo.  Deli meats taste fresh and the bread is hours old.  

The service is very quick, but that is the advertising plan, isn't it!  The drive-in seems slower than walk-in.  But don't you want to know if your sandwich bounced off the floor?!  Get out of the car and watch them work."
Horrible it's been my second time coming here around 10:30 and having to wait over 20 mins. The guys are too busy smoking weed & not doing their job. This place needs a new manager or something it's ridiculous. Like how long does it take to make 3 cookies and a smoothie smh!!!!
"The cupcakes aren't really cupcakes per se. Instead, they are cream and a little bit of cupcake below. The chocolate chip cookie was hard, but the ice cream was good. Overall overpriced and not really worth checking out given the low quality."
"I ordered a red bean milk tea and my friend ordered the original milk tea. Both were underwhelming. Both watered down. 

We also ordered their Oreo waffle with matcha green tea ice cream. It was normal, nothing impressive. The matcha ice cream was sweet.

Not worth coming back."
"We went here on a Saturday and we will be back often. Friendly service, delicious flavors. It was such a brilliant idea to have a platter where you can taste several things then, get more of what you like the best!
Excellent. Highly recommended."
"Worst place ever based on a number of different experiences. I took my daughter in for a bladder infection and the male doctor wanted to do a full exam of her women parts. When I said no he got irratated and short with me... sorry not going to make my 9 year old who was sitting there in tears go through that. I took my 15 month old twins in for a check up. They called and asked if I could change my appointment to a time slot 30 minutes early than the original so I did... I ended waiting in the waiting room for an hour! When we finally got pulled back only because I complained, the nurse stunk like BO so bad like she hadn't showered in days. We put my daughter on the baby scale she was poopy  when I took the diaper off so I said oh one sec I'll clean her up. She said no it's okay and weighed my daughter while she squirmed around in her poop! By the time I got back in the room I said were leaving and did not finish the appointment. That's only 2 occasions. I've probably said I'm never going back there on at least 4 different occasions, but this time I'm NEVER going back there and you should NOT take your children there!!"
"Tacos Are Basic Asf, Fries With The Twist Wasn't So Special. I Have Came Here Expecting The Unexpected. If You Wish To Try, Do Not Go There After 6pm As Your Expectation Will Grow With Time Passing By(a 1 Hour That Is) Instagram Had Brought Me Here, But Anyone That Eats Taco's Know The LowKey Spots Are The Way To Go. Will I Share Me Secret Spot You Will Never Know."
"Another top notch Fox restaurant. They do have the formula down. I cant say this place is anything really incredible or unique. But what it does it does very well. Its affordable. Its very trendy. The quality seems to be top notch. Service was excellent. Our dessert came out approximately 5 minutes after we ordered. It was delivered to us by the manager with apologies that it took so long and it was on the house. We had the warm peanut butter cup. I'm not a huge dessert person, especially chocolate ones, but it was good. The cookie on the side really deserves to be broken up and tossed in the bowl with the gelato. Getting back to the beginning of the meal, we had an appetizer of bacon potato fritters. They are amazingly light and airy. The taste of bacon was only slight. Everything is better with bacon right? The entrees were order were the ricotta dumpling bolognese and the meatloaf special. The dumpling were great. Again light and airy, almost slightly dry. A tad more moist and they could be gnocchi. The bolognese sauce were fairly oily. Most likely from the fat rendered from the cooking of the ground beef. I do think of myself as a meatloaf expert. I'm not easy to please. It was made perfectly. A perfect sweet glaze on top and a moist tender center. Nothing cutting edge with this. Just the basic meatloaf but done well. The mashed potatoes were a let down. I prefer my mashed potatoes on the rustic side. These were obviously whipped in some type of food processor. They get a slightly gluey texture when processed. We had a bottle of Stronghold Nachise with dinner. A great pairing for what we had. I was impressed they dont gouge you on wine prices. Their markup seems to be a more reasonable 100%. I've seen many places triple and quadruple the retail price of a wine. So kudos on that. I would def go back, but not right away. There are so many other places to try yet."
